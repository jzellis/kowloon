This practice stems from the creation of <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_stick\" title=\"Tally stick\">tally sticks</a> where a mark was made on a stick with a blunt knife for each payment counted. When payment was complete the stick was split down the middle, leaving each party with half of the marked stick and creating a receipt (or foil and counter-foil). After the knives are tested the Remembrancer pronounces \"Good service\".</p><p><br>The third quit rent dates from 1327, and is for £11 in regard to the reserved interest of the Crown for the 'town of <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwark\" title=\"Southwark\">Southwark</a>'. In that year the City was granted its fourth-oldest Royal Charter to acquire Southwark from <a  href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_III\" title=\"Edward III\">Edward III</a> for this annual payment. It was specifically retained by <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VI\" title=\"Edward VI\">Edward VI</a> in the 1550 charter to the City, which extended its jurisdiction over the outlying parts of Southwark. This quit is rendered by the Foreman of the City's <a  href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_Leet\" title=\"Court Leet\">Court Leet</a> Jury of the \"Town and Borough of Southwark\", alias <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guildable_Manor\" title=\"Guildable Manor\">Guildable Manor</a>, which is the area as defined in 1327. The continuation of this body is sanctioned under the Administration of Justice Act 1977. The ceremony takes place in the Cathedral library, the Glaziers' Hall or London's City Hall. This sum is rendered onto the Exchequer Cloth in the form of <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(British_coin)\" title=\"Crown (British coin)\">Crowns</a> (5 shilling pieces, equivalent to 25 new pence), which remain legal tender. The Remembrancer pronounces \"Good service\" and this is witnessed by the Clerk of the City's Chamberlain's Court and the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorialism\" title=\"Manorialism\">manor</a> <a  href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juror\" title=\"Juror\">jurors</a> to note that the payment has been made.</p></section></blockquote><p><br><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Remembrancer\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Remembrancer</a></p>",

                "content": "<p><p >I am sitting in a room. It’s November 2nd, 2020, the day before the United States presidential election, half past eight in the evening, Greenwich Mean Time. The room is small, cluttered and only lit by cool dim LED fairy lights and the glow of my iPad. The only sound I hear is the whirrrrring of a small fan and the muffled voices of neighbors speaking a foreign language in the house next door.</p><p>The room is in a village just northwest of the boundaries of Greater London, England. I have been here since July, with my fiance, who is local. The village is quiet and suburban, like almost the entirety of this country, which consists of a few galactic clusters of population — London, Birmingham, Manchester, Bristol — with smooth gradations of habitation between; the urban cores fade to suburbia with many or no centers, and sometimes to “rural” areas which, to the eyes of an American grown up mostly in Texas and the West, still look like suburbs, or maybe exurbs — the sort of places where people can keep horses, but where you’re never more than twenty minutes or so from a supermarket and the buses still run. </p><p>I haven’t seen much of England due to circumstance and the pandemic — just this area, bits of London proper and a day trip down to Brighton on the southern shore to be assaulted by thieving and violent seagulls intent on my fish and chips — but what I have seen mostly reminds me of The Kinks’ song “The Village Green Preservation Society”. It’s quiet and subdued and the police blotter in the local paper is like something out of a Bill Hicks comedy routine: teenagers knocking over dustbins in the high street or shouting rude things at elderly dogwalkers. </p><p>It’s a calm and lovely place to recover from an open heart triple bypass, which I had in March, in Las Vegas, where I came here from. Even my limited access to NHS services — which I keep attempting to pay for out of pocket, which seems to baffle the doctors and receptionists, who insist that someone will sort it out and bill me eventually — has provided infinitely better care than I received in my own country, where I do not and did not have health care. Aside from a single checkup appointment with a doctor, a month after I was released early from the hospital due to to concerns over the coronavirus, the only followup I have gotten from the hospital where I received my emergency heart surgery are daily calls to pay my bill, which would probably cover the cost of a decent house in one of those horse-friendly exurbs.</p><p>My heart seems fine, but I have had complications with my muscles, my skin, my nerves, in my chest and shoulders and my left leg, where they removed the veins they grafted into my heart. My entire chest is still painful to the touch, and even wearing a shirt is unpleasant. Sometimes when I breathe deeply, I have a sensation inside my chest like a dented car door buckling as it’s opened and closed, and my right rotator cuff has somehow gotten badly torn and is impinging the ulnar nerve in my arm. </p><p>The doctor up the road is doing what they can for me, but they’re limited by my lack of citizenship and the pandemic, which has been very costly here in Hertfordshire, and so at the moment my main course of treatment is physiotheraputic exercises and a shit ton of codeine and anti-inflammatories.</p><p>Perhaps because of the cold or the damp, today has been especially bad, and so I’ve taken a great deal of painkillers indeed, and so my mind is gently drifting on a cloud as I refresh my social media and news feeds, again and again, desperate for some new news.</p><p>I am terrified of what tomorrow will bring. There are almost no possible futures branching out after tomorrow evening, American time, that do not lead down very dark paths indeed, and all of them I can foresee — and foreseeing things is what I am very good at — lead not to the center, but to the edges of the spectrum that lies between fascism and chaos.</p><br /><br /><br /><p >I am an antifascist, though I do not belong to the imaginary “antifa” organization that Trump and his lackeys have made such a boogeyman for the American right wing. I simply despise fascism, and fascists, and white supremacy and white nationalism and the intertwining of any religion and the state, and authoritarianism of any kind. I believe in a strong welfare state because I know that it makes a nation stronger when its citizens can live and work without the terror of having no home, no food, no medical care, no jobs. By European standards, this makes me a dull centrist; by American standards, it makes me Josef Stalin. </p><p>After the last election, in 2016, I got the word <strong>antifascist.</strong> tattooed on my left pectoral muscle. It seemed necessary. I am a big, burly, bearded cisgendered heterosexual middle aged white man with bad teeth who grew up in Texas and, until I came here, drove a four wheel drive pickup truck. My family were in the oil business and, by all appearances, I am Donald Trump’s exact target demographic.</p><p>So the tattoo seemed like a way of committing myself, a very tiny way of stripping away from myself my innate racial and cultural privileges. I can never be anything but a cishet white American man, but I could at least mark myself as an enemy of those who would place all of society’s wealth and power solely in the hands of people who look like me. The tattoo was an attempt to practice what I preach, to hold myself accountable to the stand I take. </p><p>(You can argue that, if I had been <em>really</em> intent on marking myself for what I am, I would have done it on some part of my body that isn’t hidden underneath a shirt, and you might well be right, but the truth is I put it on my chest because I didn’t want to mess with the aesthetic balance of my existing arm tattoos.)</p><p>And now, of course, I am facing the consequences of my decision... and the reason I am refreshing those feeds so often and desperately is because, if Donald Trump remains President of the United States, I will be in very real danger the moment I set foot on my native soil. As long as he and his cadre of fascists and white supremacists hold sway over America, I will be a refugee. Because I will not allow myself to be killed by fascists.</p><br /><br /><br /><p >When I got to London in July, I was stopped at immigration and sat in a waiting area nearby — exhausted from the long, claustrophobic airplane ride and wearing my Covid-19 face mask for something like twenty hours straight, and confused and terrified — until a very friendly woman came to sit with me and announced herself as a detective from Special Branch, who handle counterterrorism and similar issues in the United Kingdom.</p><p>The interview was brief and friendly, but it became clear that, for some reason, my politics were in question, I told her that I had never been arrested, nor involved with any militant groups, and that I was about as radical a leftist as Jeremy Corbyn. After what felt like hours but was probably about ten or fifteen minutes of me tiredly babbling at her, she told me I was free to go and that I wasn’t in any trouble. Frankly she seemed to regard the entire thing as a waste of time.</p><p>Afterwards, I tried to puzzle it out. Why on Earth would they send a Special Branch detective to talk to me? When I spoke to the immigration official earlier, the interview was brief and cursory, with no obvious red flags. I wasn’t carrying any contraband or anything illegal with me. So why the counterterrorism cop?</p><p>The only sense I could make of it was that the Americans had put me on some kind of watch list. </p><p>It actually made sense, because last December the US Customs and Border Patrol had denied my fiance entry to the US to spend Christmas with my family and me. She’d not outstayed her visa on previous visits; it seemed that the entire issue was that she’d visited the US too often over the past two years, which they dubbed suspicious. The CBP and its individual border patrol agents have absolute authority over such matters; there is no authority to appeal to in such situations. They have absolute power over anyone entering the United States.</p><p>I told my fiance to stay in Montreal, where she’d attempted to pass customs, and immediately called my Congresswoman and my Senator, and flew to Montreal myself to help sort it out. Senator Rosen’s office were incredibly helpful, reaching out to both the CBP and the State Department, though her staff cautioned me that they had no actual power to reverse the CBP’s decision; they could only advocate on my behalf.</p><p>After spending a week and a half — including Christmas — in Montreal hotel rooms, the local US consulate finally issued her a tourist visa and we headed to the airport. I waited for her while an CBP officer grilled her in their office. </p><p>As I did, I noticed a tattoo on the arm of another officer who wandered by — an American flag shield that looked familiar to me. I looked it up on my phone as I waited, and though I only saw it for a second, and I could be mistaken, I’m fairly certain it was the symbol of the American Guard, a group which the Jewish Anti-Defamation League consider “hardcore white supremacists”.</p><p>They allowed Michelle in, with a stern warning that this was the last time she’d be let into America, and we managed to spend a week or so in Las Vegas with my family. Not long afterwards, a <em>Vice</em> reporter contacted me about reports of white supremacists infiltrating the ICE offices in Pahrump, near Las Vegas — I was a newspaper journalist in Vegas for many years and I keep an eye on such things — and as an aside, I mentioned my recent experience in Montreal and the CBP officer’s tattoo to her.  She made a particular note of it, as I recall.</p><p>If she followed up on it, I haven’t seen any articles — I suspect the pandemic derailed a lot of long-term journalistic investigations. Or maybe it simply went nowhere. And maybe I was wrong.</p><p>But that, combined with my campaign through Senator Rosen’s office and my moderately large presence on social media, made me think that it was was entirely possible that the CBP put me on some sort of watch list. I have repeatedly condemned them and called them out for their frequent abhorrent treatment of immigrants and detainees along the Mexican border, and have openly offered to help anyone in Las Vegas afraid of being caught up in ICE or CBP sweeps avoid them. </p><p>So the idea of finding myself on their shit list doesn’t seem particularly paranoid to me... especially at a time when the sitting president of the United States refers to antifascists as “terrorists”.</p><p>The CBP has, as I said, absolute authority and can act with absolute impunity at any port of entry to the United States. In the current heightened climate, with a President and a Department of Justice and a State Department who will back them to the hilt without any hesitation, is it really that unrealistic to imagine myself detained upon my return to the US as a suspected terrorist or radical? And — considering that I had my breastbone sawed in half and wired back together and three veins extracted from my leg and grafted onto my heart, only a few months ago — is it really unrealistic to worry that if they decided to get rough with me, as American law enforcement at every level is prone to do, that an overapplication of force or restraint could fuck me up permanently or even kill me? They could claim anything they liked afterwards: that I was aggressive, that I attempted to escape, that I was trying to smuggle drugs or guns or anything at all into the country. They could promise a full investigation, and make frowny faces and say that “mistakes were made”, as they often do.</p><p>And I would be no less crippled or dead because of it.</p><p>I do not trust the Customs and Border Patrol. I do not trust the American government, so long as Donald Trump is running it, to treat me as anything but the enemy that he and his flunkies have openly declared me to be. And as difficult as it has been to pack away my life and leave my home country, I will not return until I feel safe to do so. If I can’t stay in the UK — if my fiance and I can’t sort out any way to do that — I will simply travel to and between the few countries currently allowing Americans to enter their borders, until I believe that I can come home without harm. As exhausting and difficult as that sounds at my age and in my current state of ill health, it’s better than the alternative.</p><br /><br /><br /><p >So here I sit, in this quiet, dark little room; Michelle has gone to sleep early in the bedroom with the cat curled against her, but I am far from sleep. Tomorrow is one of those days upon which the fortunes of nations are settled or unsettled, but for me it’s not just that — what happens tomorrow defines my personal future as well.</p><p>I have no idea how the election will turn out. I don’t know if Trump will lose. I think he will almost certainly lose the popular vote again, but he might swing the Electoral College, by fair or foul. And even if he loses in a landslide, I don’t believe he will concede the Presidency. He will attempt to tie things up in a tangled, chaotic knot, and his supporters will, I think, try to silence and stop his opponents through intimidation and outright violence. I’m not sure how that plays out either — whether the American Left will simply cave under the threat of civil war, or whether they will fight back.</p><p>Donald Trump is a tumor in the body politic of America... and like a tumor, even if the operation to excise him tomorrow is successful, it’s no guarantee that the malignancy that spawned him will leave with him. And so tonight I feel like a man waiting for a surgery — a risky one that will require months or years to recover from and which may still not get the job done.</p><p>If it doesn’t, I don’t think the America I come from, where I was born, will exist for much longer, at least not in any form I recognize or could survive in. And that mental and emotional pain is as exhausting as my current physical pain. I’m tired of Donald Trump. I’m tired of fascists and murderous cops and corporate oligarchy. I’m tired of reading interviews with small town bigots in big city newspapers, where they are portrayed with sympathy as they spew witless, uneducated gibberish that can only come from people who’ve never been outside their tiny communities. I’m tired of QAnon and all the batshit conspiracy theories. I’m tired of Nazis and the Klan and the respectable face of white supremacy. I’m tired of watching incompetent nepotists mismanage the American response to the pandemic. I’m tired of watching black Americans die at the hands of cops and brown children of many nations lie on pallets on concrete floors in cages. I’m tired of the Electoral College making a mockery of the idea that America is or ever was a true democracy. I’m tired of seeing millions of Americans sleeping in the streets, rousted from their sleeping bags, treated like criminals for not having enough money. I’m tired of seeing guns have more rights than women or gay or trans people. I’m tired of seeing myself and friends and family members suffer and even die from lack of the same kind of taxpayer-funded nationalized healthcare system that every other developed nation has.</p><p>I am tired of the fight. And so I hope more than anything that I wake up on Wednesday morning to the dawn of a new American era, but I don’t count on it. I think the fight is only beginning, and I wonder if we still have the strength and will to fight it, collectively and as individuals.</p><p>And I can’t help but think of what Paul Simon once wrote, in a song about America and those who, in the past came to her shores seeking a better life. Though his song is about immigrants, it applies just as well to me, an exile in a green and pleasant land, watching with trepidation as the country I love slouches towards either rebirth or death:</p><p><em>We come on the ship they call the Mayflower<br>We come on the ship that sailed the moon<br>We come in the age’s most uncertain hour<br>And sing an American tune<br>Oh, but it’s alright, it’s alright<br>Can’t be forever blessed<br>Still, tomorrow’s gonna be another working day<br>And I’m trying to get some rest<br>That’s all, I’m trying to get some rest.</em></p><br />",

                "content": "<p><p >So here we are, a week away from the 2020 US election, which will almost certainly decide whether or not the United States has a future as a viable nation-state. If that seems like an exaggeration, you probably don't really understand the scale of the mess America is in. </p><p>There is, for only maybe the second time in American history, a very real chance that an actual civil war will break out over the results of a presidential election. It’s not as unthinkable as most Americans believe. My friends who still live in rural parts of the West tell me people in their towns are quite literally locking and loading, buying up ammo in preparation if Trump loses. To do what, exactly? I don’t know. I can’t imagine they think they’re going to run an insurgency against the US military... but I think they believe that they won’t have to.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/11/what-if-trump-refuses-concede/616424/\">This <em>Atlantic</em> article lays it out pretty well</a>, but the biggest barrier to predicting the events of the next three or four months in America is not that Trump will not concede the election. It’s not a barrier because it’s a near certainty. There is no version of this where Trump acknowledges defeat, gracefully or otherwise. </p><p>No, the biggest barrier is that there’s no clear answer to what happens after that, after he claims it was rigged, that mail-in ballots were fraudulent, that he’s still the President. There’s no clear answer because the Framers of the Constitution never imagined such a possibility happening. They may have been racist, misogynist, slave-owning white supremacist douchebags, but they also existed at a time when gentlemen simply did not behave that way.</p><p>But Trump is the polar opposite of the definition of a gentleman, then or now, and he’s going to kick up a ruckus and absolutely push it as far as it will go. He’s a textbook psychopath with a fragile ego, the worst sense of Rich White Man entitlement this earth has ever seen, and is likely facing prison — along with his immediate family — once he’s out from under the roof of the White House. He is not mentally or emotionally capable of grace, much less grace in defeat.</p><p>And so that leads us to a very bad place for the most powerful and wealthiest nation-state in a world interlocked by global networks of economy and finance and industry to be in: namely, chaos.</p><hr /><br /><br /><br /><p >This winter is going to be very very hard indeed, on America and Americans and indeed the entire world. COVID-19 has kicked the moorings out from underneath the engine of global capitalism and showed how desperately fragile it really is, contrary to the bluster and bluff of free market advocates who insist that it is the economic version of Darwinian selection — which it is, to some extent, but that’s not a good thing on the day when the asteroid comes and ruthless efficiency of food-gathering isn’t as useful as being small enough to hide in cracks and warm-blooded enough to survive the endless winter afterwards. Modern, Milton Friedman-idolizing late stage corporate capitalism relies above all else upon endless increase of profit margins, and as we’ve seen, when they cease due to something that money can’t seem to control, such as the coronavirus, businesses that have lasted centuries die sad deaths over the course of a few months. </p><p>One of the most serious forms of collateral damage from this is going to be in the form of mass evictions, as soon as the moratoriums put in place by various jurisdictions run out. A lot of people don’t seem to understand that these moratoriums are not debt jubilees — if you haven’t paid rent since March, you’ll owe it, January 1st. All of it. Whether or not your landlord is willing to take payments, whether they charge you consecutive late fees for all that time accrued, is probably going to be entirely at their own discretion.</p><p>One of the things that modern capitalism is incapable of is systems thinking; it’s every capitalist for themselves, swimming the heady seas of commerce like a shoal of fish that forms a shape like an Invisible Hand. But that narrow focus, that greed and pitilessness, is one of capitalism’s failure points. </p><p>In this case, millions of landlords and property managers protecting their individual investments by evicting people who, in many cases, are still unemployed or underemployed due to the pandemic, is going to cause a cascading series of economic failures that will, in and of themselves, bring America to its knees. A key point to remember here is that <em>this will happen regardless of the election outcome</em>, as even if Biden is elected he won’t take office until January 20th, by which time those eviction processes will have already begun and, in many cases, be carried out. The likelihood of another federal moratorium extension are slim to none — and while many states will enforce their own, others won’t. </p><p>So that’s one major crisis waiting in the wings. Another is that there’s a pretty good chance that this winter will prove to be another extremely cold one, due to polar vortices coming in from the north, borne on the currents caused by rapid Arctic ice melt. That’s always bad, but combine it with millions of Americans suddenly displaced due to evictions or climate collapse events like the fires in the West, and you’re looking at a deadly one-two combo punch indeed.</p><p>And, of course, the virus; the virus that is on track to kill a quarter of a million Americans by mid-November and maybe a half million by Inauguration Day, and which is absolutely kicking the living hell out of not only domestic but foreign trade. Despite Trump’s witless babbling, the coronavirus shows no signs of petering out and there’s no vaccine in sight.</p><p>The best metaphor for this fourth quarter of 2020 is what William Gibson refers to, in his recent novels <em>The Peripheral</em> and <em>Agency</em>, as “the Jackpot”: a notional set of crises which could, individually, be managed with massive coordinated effort... but which all hit at the same moment, like a royal flush on a Vegas slot machine, leaving the entire planet punch-drunk and on the ropes.</p><p>And into this existentially precarious moment — precarious for not only America but the entire human race — walks Donald J. Trump, the human equivalent of a beer mug falling off a bar in the middle of a tense old West saloon showdown.</p><hr /><br /><br /><br /><p >Partially because of the Founding Fathers’ inability to imagine absolutely shameless sons-of-bitches like Trump and Mitch O’Connell getting into the driver’s seats of America, and partially because of their own inefficacy and fecklessness, it seems unlikely that the Democratic Party will do much if Trump decides to cut loose after the election. The problem is that, like the Republicans, the Democrats have come to understand American democracy not as the mechanism of providing for and doing the will of the people, but as a team sport in which winning is not defined by carrying out the objective of good governance, but by getting votes and holding districts. A cynical man would argue that both parties are most interested in the gaining of power in order to sell it to the highest bidder; I am a cynical man and I do in fact argue this, but not at the moment. Electoral politics is always corrupt, but this goes beyond simple pork barrels and lobbyists with their hands in their pockets.</p><p>The Democrats fancy themselves as five-dimensional chess players, and maybe by the laughable standards of Washington they are. But the problem is that they’re sitting down at an exquisitely carved chess board across from Leatherface from <em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em>. They’re thinking five moves ahead... except their opponent isn’t actually moving his pieces. He’s waving that Husqvarna around and sawing through the chairs and the walls and the table the chess board is sitting on, while the Democrats sit there and make impatient scoffing noises and demand to know if we, the American public, can see what this guy is doing? He’s not even strategizing correctly! It’s like <em>he isn’t playing the same game as them at all</em>.</p><p>So when Trump starts calling the election a fraud, and attempting to send his own electors — hand-picked by Stephen Miller or Jared Kushner, because Trump has the attention span of a fruit fly on PCP and isn’t interested in conversations about other people, because other people are not Donald Trump and therefore irrelevant to his interests — the Democrats are going to continue to do what they’ve done so far, which is release a series of strongly-worded condemnations. The Senate belongs to the Republicans, so there isn’t much they can do anyway. And if the Democrats are team players, the Republicans are more akin to a death cult. They have no allegiance to America or the American people, which they prove in every election by trying every means, fair or foul, to rig the outcome in their favor, through cheap stunts and gerrymandering and voter intimidation. They only care about total victory, and as one of their elder statesmen and heroes once said: they will burn the village to save it.</p><p>But let’s imagine an unlikely scenario: Joe Biden absolutely sweeps the election in a landslide, one that not even a Republican-held Senate or Trump’s newly-packed Supreme Court can call into question. Trump continues to mewl and simper about “fraud” and “antifa” and whatever, right up until the moment that Biden shows up to the White House and Trump is, as Biden has suggested, frog-marched out of the joint. America’s long nightmare is over... right?</p><p>Nope. That’s when things <em>really</em> go off the rails. Because even without the office of the Presidency, Trump is a cult leader, and his cult consists of millions of Americans, the least-educated and least-intelligent and least-tolerant and most belligerent sector of the citizenry... and America is a country where lack of education or intelligence or tolerance or an even temper present zero barriers to purchasing and maintaining large collections of military-grade weapons and ammo.</p><p>I think that, for these people, collective street-level violence come January 20th is not a question. The only question is whether they get to be the Imperial stormtroopers or the Rebel Alliance, but I don’t think they care very much. What they care about is what the Democrats should care a lot more about than they appear to: that this is a pivot point in the history of America, and that this is either the end of the dominance of the far right wing in American politics or culture or its triumph. </p><p>So let me put this plainly and bluntly: I believe there’s a pretty good chance that these people will attempt to start an armed insurrection or an all-out civil war, at some point between Election Day and Inauguration Day. I don’t think it will be a territorial war, no North vs. South or even ISIS attempting to reclaim the lands of the ancient caliphate; I think it will be everywhere, in every part of America. I think it will be factional, like the various post-Soviet conflicts that broke out in the Balkans and other hotspots in the 1990s; I think they will not meet much active resistance from non-state leftist actors or activists; I think the federal government will be paralyzed by this crisis of leadership and unable to effectively respond; and I think that, on top of <em>every other goddamned thing happening right at the exact same moment</em>, that there is a fairly good chance that the United States of America will be a failed state by next summer, because — politics aside — the already-teetering economy cannot withstand this level of chaos.</p><p>How do we avoid this? I’ll be honest: I have no idea. It might be that Trump losing the election badly will take the wind out of the sails of the various increasingly organized right-wing militias and movements. It might be that the Democrats manage to sweep both the House and Senate, as well as win the presidency, and that might be enough to allow them to offer a decisive response to Trump’s recklessness and chaos creation. It might be that some of the Republicans remember that they serve <em>all</em> the American people, not just the ones in their party, and stand up to their thoroughly immoral leadership. Stranger things have happened.</p><p>But of course, none of that is likely. The system has been gamed so thoroughly and the Republican Party so thoroughly infiltrated by crazies and mercenaries and psychopaths and delusional Jesus freaks since 1980 or so that none of that is likely at all. I think a stalemate in the halls of power is the best case scenario... and that stalemate will not carry out into the streets.</p><p>So if I’m right, and America does break out into factional civil war or street-level insurrection and violence on a massive scale? How does that play out? I have no idea. Depending on who actually ends up in the White House, we might see UN peacekeepers in American streets next year, but I doubt it. I think that nobody on Earth, no other nation or collection of nations, is willing to directly intervene in this lunacy, despite the fact that every country on Earth will be impacted directly or indirectly by it.</p><p>For example, the United Kingdom — where I currently sit — is in a lot of trouble if America goes apeshit. Boris Johnson and the Tories have entirely put all of their post-Brexit eggs into the basket of new trade agreements with the US; if those agreements don’t happen, the UK is in very serious trouble and very well may lose Scotland to independence and EU membership. China may win political supremacy if America falls, but too much of their economy currently relies on American trade and manufacturing for them to easily withstand even a brief period without it. Russia? Russia would be happy to see America fall, but it’s not like they’re in any position to take our place economically. This is more about settling scores than anything else. And of course, if America falls, the already precarious situation in the Middle East explodes. Israel loses her biggest ally, but the Saudis also lose their biggest customer.</p><p>An America divided in violent civil war would not necessarily mean the end of the world, but it would probably mean a shake-up unseen on the planet since the end of the second World War, and maybe something more akin to the fall of Rome in terms of a complete and rapid redefinition of the status quo. And maybe more dramatic even than that, because Rome did not sit at the center of a global spiderweb of money and war and diplomacy the way America does. The end of America could be the geopolitical version of a singularity; a phase change so dramatic that it’s impossible to predict what the world looks like on the other side of it.</p><p>I certainly can’t. But I’m frightened enough of it that I am not going to return to America if I can help it in the near future. If I can’t find a way to stay with my partner here in the UK, I’ll go to one of the other entries on the short list of nations that are allowing Americans to enter during the pandemic. I’d rather live on bread and butter in some village in rural Turkey than return to a country that’s the equivalent of a gunpowder factory, with a big stupid orange asshole real estate con artist from Queens standing out front with a Zippo in his fat fingers.</p><p>If you are one of the hundreds of millions of my fellow Americans who were not lucky enough to have an exit strategy and find yourself trapped in a volatile country on the edge of chaos with no easy means of escape, my advice is to get as ready as you can for whatever comes, and <em>do not assume that a</em> <em>Biden win will end</em> <em>the turmoil</em>. In fact, it may precipitate it. Be wary, pay attention, and if you have a way to get clear of the madness, take it.</p><p>I am scared for you, for all of you, and for all of us, every human on the planet. Because a hard rain’s a-gonna fall, and God only knows who will be left when the waters recede. Hopefully it will be most of us; hopefully it will be any of us at all.</p><p><em>Vaya con Dios, mi</em> <em>amigos</em>.</p><br />",

Most of the people who live in rural America these days are either trapped here by circumstance -- getting married or pregnant early, or simply not having the money or the opportunity to move away -- or because they reject the values of the big city. (It's slightly more complicated than that, but, well, that's a whole other blog post.)</p><p></p><p>I found myself recommending to her -- as I have to several of my friends here who are young and at loose ends -- that she learn to code, as a way to take hold of her own economic destiny, and that of her children.</p><p></p><p>New readers might think at this point \"God, yet another fatuous tech bro telling people all their problems will be solved if they just learn to code.\" But longtime readers, and anyone who <em>knows </em>me, will know that I am decidedly not one of those people at all. I have argued at great length that one of the great failings of the tech industry is the nonsense notion that it's a simple meritocracy -- that anybody can do what we do.</p><p></p><p>The thing is, I think that <em>is</em> true... but only in the most theoretical of theory. The reality is far different.</p><p></p><p>I have one of the most diverse socioeconomic backgrounds of anyone I've ever known, but go ahead and assume, for the moment, that as far as this discussion goes I'm an average sample of the tech industry: a straight white male raised in the middle class. I got my first computer from my grandfather, an electrical engineer, when I was five years old: a Commodore VIC-20, along with a book on BASIC programming. \"Where are the games?\" I asked him. \"Write some,\" he replied. So I did, crappy little text adventure games, with very simple if/then logic. Nothing to write home about. but not bad for a little kid in 1983. I was kind of a prodigy.</p><p></p><p>My family saw to it that I always had a computer growing up -- not always the fastest or newest, but something. I got on BBSes when I got a modem in the late 80s; I started fucking around with Photoshop in 1993; I made my first HTML page in 1995; I wrote my first PHP code in 1999 or so. I've been doing it for money ever since -- sometimes good money, often bad, but I've never really been out of work if I was willing to hustle to get it.</p><p></p><p>My friend? She was not so lucky. She's had a hard life. She's a first generation Mexican-American, a child of divorce, who got pregnant young. She's never had money or access to resources or advanced education other than what she might get at the local community college.</p><p></p><p>Despite that, she's incredibly brave and smart and curious. She's perfectly capable of being a web developer. But the biggest difference between me and her is that nobody ever <em>told</em> her she could be a web developer. That was never an option that was put on the table for her, the same way that option is almost <em>never </em>put on the table for poor people in this country.</p><p></p><p>But here's the secret I want to share with you: anybody really <em>can</em> be a coder in America. It requires, basically, four things:</p><p><ol></p><p><li>A computer. Not even a great computer; a used $200 laptop from a pawn shop will work perfectly well.</li></p><p><li>An Internet connection, or regular access to one, at the library or a coffeeshop if you don't have one at home.</li></p><p><li>A certain amount of time each day to devote to learning.</li></p><p><li>A willingness to bang your head against the knowledge you need until it makes sense.</li></p><p></ol></p><p>If you want to be a Web developer, you need to know three things: HTML, CSS and Javascript. That's basically it. (And you need to understand the basic client-server architecture of the Internet, but that's not even absolutely necessary to get into in any hardcore super-geeky detail.) That's not a small amount of information, by any means, but I know people who've walked into the \"coding bootcamps\" that are so popular these days and walked out three months later with enough knowledge to get a job in the industry immediately.</p><p></p><p>Of course, most poor folks can't afford either the enrollment fees or the time off work to attend such a bootcamp. But I would estimate that in six months, studying for two or three hours a day, five days a week, you can learn enough to get an entry-level position in tech. A gig at a hip San Francisco startup? Probably not, unless you're middle class and know people. But here's the great thing about tech: <em>everybody needs it</em>. The big employer in your small town needs somebody to write web apps, or at least maintain a Wordpress site. Local businesses will pay for you to make them websites. That entry level gig won't be sexy, but it will almost certainly pay more than minimum wage...and in a place like Yakima, where the divide between the haves and the have-nots is pretty huge, that's a big deal. It's a ladder leading upward.</p><p></p><p>One objection people often raise to me is: <i>I'm not into that computer stuff. It's boring.</i> Yeah, it can be, especially at first. After a while, it's not. After a while, you're excited by the potential you have to make things that can a) make you decent money and b) maybe, possibly, perhaps, change the world. And more importantly: you know what's more boring than looking at computer code all day? Working as a cashier at fucking Walmart for minimum wage for the rest of your life.</p><p></p><p>Would you rather have a job that was boring and paid you $75K a year or a job that was even <em>more </em>boring, except you're taking home a third of that, <em>and </em>being treated like a disposable piece of garbage by your employer, <em>and</em> having to wear a stupid vest?</p><p></p><p>If you've never lived in a place like Yakima, it's hard to really understand how limited your options are if you didn't start out with money and you can't run the hell away. Working as a Walmart stocker or a McDonald's fry cook or cleaning motel rooms isn't an afterschool thing for high school kids: it's <em>good, steady work</em>. Career advancement? Sure, you might end up an assistant manager or shift supervisor. You might even take night classes at Yakima Valley College so you can get a job as a machinist or a nurse. Maybe. If you can find somebody to watch your kids...except babysitters cost money, and if you're making $9 an hour, where's that money coming from?</p><p></p><p>But you don't need a degree to work in tech, not even an AA from a community college. Shit, I'm a high school dropout. I have a GED. I went to a semester of art school before I dropped out to write and code full time. Nobody fucking cares -- and if they do, they're probably douchebags, and not worth working for. I respect academic achievement, but in the tech industry, it's not a requirement. Ability is what matters, very generally speaking.</p><p></p><p>And as much as I firmly believe the tech industry has a strong (if often oblivious and unintentional) streak of misogyny and racism running through it, I also believe that if you're legitimately smart and good at what you do, you will always find a way to at least get your foot in the door... and once you're in, you have the opportunity to be part of the solution, making things better for people like you.</p><p></p><p>I realize that sounds simplistic, but look: nothing will change in tech unless there are more people working within it who <em>want</em> change, who are willing to stand up and speak out and push for that change. And that means more people of color, more women, more people who aren't middle class white and Asian dudes who went to Stanford or Berkeley. We <em>know</em> what the problem is; let's work on getting people in the door who can fix it.</p><p></p><p>One of the things I'd like to do here in Yakima -- one of the things that would make living out here in almost total social and cultural isolation worth it for me -- would be to set up free basic Web development classes that would be open to the public. Anyone could attend, but I'd focus my outreach specifically on the Hispanic migrant worker population and the Native Americans on the reservation, who are the poorest and most marginalized groups here.</p><p></p><p>Poverty begets poverty; marginalization begets marginalization. The institutional treatment of Hispanics and Natives in Eastern Washington ranges from paternal to patronizing to frankly barbaric. The city of Yakima has been <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/federal-court-rules-yakimas-voting-system-violates-voting-rights-act\" target=\"_blank\">embroiled in a suit with the ACLU over redistricting</a> that would give Hispanics a better chance to get on the city council and be involved in running a community in which, depending on the season, they may actually be the majority. No one has given any reasonable explanation I have found for why the city would fight the redistricting, except that Yakima is a city that's always been run by the rich white people who own the vineyards and orchards and fruit packing companies, where Latinos are routinely regarded by the Anglo community as little more than gangsters and drug dealers and ignorant laborers.</p><p></p><p>And I don't know much about the situation of the Natives on the Yakama Nation reservation that borders the city, but the little I <em>do</em> know about -- like the <a href=\"http://www.nrcprograms.org/site/PageServer?pagename=airc_hist_boardingschools\" target=\"_blank\">old boarding schools where Native children were given \"white\" names and converted to Christianity</a>, a practice which <a href=\"http://www.tribal-institute.org/lists/icwa.htm\" target=\"_blank\">continued until 1978</a> -- does not lead me to suspect everything is coming up roses out there, either.</p><p></p><p>For the majority of the Hispanics who come here, success is defined as earning enough money to feed their families here and send money to those who were left back home, and maybe to open a small business of their own some day like an auto repair shop or a <em>carniceria</em>. The idea that their children might become startup CEOs or CTOs is as ridiculous and inconceivable an idea as the idea that they'll grow up to wrangle unicorns for a living. Tech is a <em>gringo</em> thing. So they don't encourage their kids to pursue those dreams, and neither does anybody else, the same way nobody encourages a black kid living in the projects in inner-city Los Angeles or Chicago or Queens to be a coder. Better to be <em>realistic</em>, right?</p><p></p><p>The pathway to getting there isn't hidden, exactly; aside from a few red-pill shitbags, nobody's actively <em>trying</em> to keep people of color or women out of the tech industry. But nobody's going out of their way to shine a beacon to draw them in or make them feel welcome, either. Hell, most tech folks wouldn't know which way to point such a beacon if they did.</p><p></p><p>This is where the tech industry's image of itself as a meritocracy fails, in my opinion, because most people within it have no concept of what the world outside of their middle-class upbringing is really like. They think anybody can win the game if they play hard enough. But to win a game, you first have to be aware that a game even <em>exists</em>...and that you, too, can sit at the table and play.</p><p></p><p>To me, this is one of the most important things we in the tech industry can work to accomplish. If I could figure a way to do it full-time here and still earn a living, I would, but I don't even know how to go about that. I <em>am</em> considering donating my time to teaching such classes, at least as soon as I'm on a little more stable ground, financially, than I have been this past year. (That too is a whole other blog post, but if you don't know me, you probably don't care.)</p><p></p><p>I'd start by choosing a curriculum from one of the free online learning resources like <a href=\"http://www.codecademy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Codecademy</a> or <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org\" target=\"_blank\">Coursera</a>, and using that as a basis for classroom education and interaction. I'd find a way to get computers in the classroom for those who don't have them -- maybe, say, hit up one of the Westside's <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com\" target=\"_blank\">reasonably successful tech companies</a> to donate netbooks. I'd start with HTML and CSS, and then offer an intro to Javascript as an advanced course. My goal would be to get the students familiar enough with these technologies that they could continue to teach themselves once the class is over, and provide them with starting points for that continuation -- teach them how to teach themselves, the way I did and a lot of geeks do.</p><p></p><p>But maybe even more importantly, my goal would be to hammer home the idea that yes, <em>this is totally something they can do</em>, just like rich Anglos. (If you're in the tech industry and don't think of yourself as \"rich\", keep in mind that for a lot of the people I'm talking about, anyone who makes more than, say, $75K a year is rich.) The trick is that there is no trick; the lie they've been taught, explicitly or implicitly, is that there's some barrier to entry that you can't cross. There isn't; they can do this.</p><p></p><p>Would this solve all the problems the migrant workers and Natives here face, or bring about a sea change in the tech industry's attitudes? Of course not. I'm not that naive. But hell, if we could help foster even the <i>possibility</i> of bringing these marginalized communities into the tech industry, it would be worth it, I think.</p><p></p><p><em>Can you imagine it?</em> That's what I asked my friend tonight. <em>Can you imagine making enough money that you didn't run out at the end of the month? Having enough to put more than you make right now into your savings account, each and every month? Never worrying about whether you're going to be able to put food on the table or pay rent, or handle the medical bills if your children get sick? Knowing that your boys would be able to go to any college they wanted, that when you were gone they wouldn't be left with nothing? Wouldn't that be worth the effort to learn this boring shit, how to make web pages and program them?</em></p><p></p><p>For most of the people who enter the tech industry, this isn't something they can only imagine -- it's the default condition of existence. Hardship, for most tech industry people, means having to move home to live with your parents in their basement because your startup ran out of funding, not moving into a homeless shelter or having two families in a two bedroom apartment. Hardship means having to share a car with your spouse, not riding a shitty public bus ten miles each way to and from work. Fear is not being successful, not getting rich or powerful or living up to your potential, of being <em>ordinary</em>.</p><p></p><p>It's not the fear that comes with seeing roaches crawl across your child's bedroom floor when you turn on the lights, and knowing that it will never get any easier than this, never get any better, no matter how hard you work; that you'll never own a home, that you'll leave nothing when you die except medical debts. It's not the terror of looking out the window of your shitty one-bedroom apartment and seeing your preteen son hanging down on the corner with the dealers, and knowing that if he isn't slinging for them already, he will be soon.</p><p></p><p>And why not? The dealers are the only people he's ever seen who drive Escalades and have money to spare. Who else has he got as a role model? You? Working your ten hour shift at Jack In The Box and coming home bone weary in your paper hat to sit in the shitty folding chair at the shitty Formica table you bought at the thrift store, choking down another fabulous meal of leftover Sourdough Jacks and stale curly fries -- the only real benefit your employer offers you, as you never get scheduled quite enough hours to qualify for insurance. Rich white motherfuckers on Fox News can blather on about the value of hard work until they're blue in the face, but even a little kid can see that hard work isn't getting <em>you</em> any fucking place at all but an early grave.</p><p></p><p>Start <em>what</em> up? Chief technical <em>what</em>? In the words of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Davis\" target=\"_blank\">Senator Clay Davis</a> on <em>The Wire</em>: <em>sheeeeeeit</em>.</p><p></p><p>Hope is not a destination; it's a doorway. If it's closed to you, you can't even guess what lies on the other side. But what if we could open that door for all those terrified, hopeless people, all those apple-pickers and corner boys and trailer trash, living and dying in the corners of this sprawling, beautiful, terrible nation of ours? Just open the door, just a crack; <em>that's how the light gets in</em>, as Leonard Cohen says.</p><p></p><p>It's not an answer, but fucking hell, y'all, it's as good a place to start as any.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

But I did post a response to Zoë Keating's </i><a href=\"http://zoekeating.tumblr.com/post/108898194009/what-should-i-do-about-youtube\" target=\"_blank\">What Should I Do About YouTube</a><em>, which has been making the rounds, and I thought it was worth republishing here, as it will be lost in the flood there.</em><em> Go read that before you read this.]</em></p><p></p><p>Hi Zoe. We don't know each other but we have a gazillion friends in common and I think we've spoken on Twitter before. I normally don't do the comments section but I thought it would be worth it this time.</p><p></p><p>Back in the Dark Ages of 2003, I founded an online music store where artists could sell their own work for their own price directly to their fans and keep 70% of the proceeds. (Maintaining infrastructure was a lot more expensive back then.) I'm a musician and the grandson and great-grandson of musicians (concert pianists) and grew up as the son of a working singer/songwriter, and I wanted to build something that empowered both artists and fans.</p><p></p><p>It failed, for a variety of reasons, and it wasn't until Bandcamp came along years and years later that I really felt like somebody had realized my dream, and done it far better than I had. Bandcamp isn't perfect but out of all of the music services out there that I know of, it has the best experience for both artists and consumers, and I say that not only as somebody who's worked in this sector for nearly fifteen years but also as someone who both buys and sells their work on Bandcamp.</p><p></p><p>And yet, in the grand scheme of things, they're a second tier service in terms of market share if not quality. Is it because they're not good at marketing? Not good at running their business? I don't think so. I think it's because they're not doing what the bigger online streaming/retailers are doing, which is showing a Janus face.</p><p></p><p>With one face, they're telling the consumers that they're about empowering them, giving them tools to create and share. But with the other face, they're reassuring the traditional music industry power structures that, no, it's gonna be business as usual. And, as in most conversations about music or any other form of creative industry these days, they're not really thinking much about the actual creator, the artist themselves, and about what you said in this post -- that it's YOUR right to decide how your work is distributed. They're giving you ultimatums that they'd do almost anything to avoid giving to either consumers or label people. Why? Because you don't have juice, as you said, and you're in a position where the flow of things dictates that you've been put between a rock and a hard place: piss off the platform or piss off the fans. I don't envy you that. (Though as a musician I do envy you actually having enough fans to worry about pissing them off. My fan base tends to get pissed when I don't call it on its birthday, but that's easily remedied by calling it up and saying \"Sorry, Mom, I'll buy you an Amazon gift card.\") ;-)</p><p></p><p>There was an article today on GigaOm dismissing the tech critic Andrew Keen, and a lot of the refutations of his (often quite valid) criticisms come down to: is a world run by the tech industry really any worse than the way it used to be? And you hear that a lot in the digital content distribution space: is this worse than when the old school record industry ran things?</p><p></p><p>And the answer is: if that's the way you have to frame that question, then it doesn't matter if it's worse, because it's clearly not much better. And ultimately it doesn't matter to the artists who's giving them the shaft: some douche with a ponytail in Hollywood or some douche with a waxed mustache in Mountain View. It's still the shaft. It still sucks.</p><p></p><p>The point of all of this technology is not to replace one shitty status quo with another one, it's to create new status quos (statii quo? Whatever, my Latin sucks.) in which everybody gets what they want. I don't think that's impossible; I don't think it's a zero sum game. But it saddens me that, in all the years since the rise of MP3s and Napster and Gnutella and everything else, the one person who seems to keep getting that shaft is not the fan clamoring for music to listen to and love, and not the executive looking for a way to monetize that clamoring, but the artist. It's always the artist. It's why The Ramones broke up because they weren't making enough money to pay the rent while touring and getting something like a $25 per diem per member.</p><p></p><p>That status quo has never changed.</p><p></p><p>But look: right now, you know who people are looking to to solve these problems? You. You are at the forefront of this new unexplored territory, you and artists like you, who are breaking this ground and asking these questions and taking these risks. I like to think of myself as a mostly unnoticed innovator in this space, but I still look to you to see how this is all playing out. I know it's not a fun position to be in, but it means that your decisions will serve as a guidepost for others to come. You're setting precedent; you're shaping things.</p><p></p><p>I don't know what to tell you to do. The punk rock part of me wants to tell you to tell Google to go fuck themselves and let's build something new. But that's an easy position for someone with no skin in the game to take. But you seem like a really smart person, and I'm sure that whatever path you take will be the one that's right for you. And no matter how much anyone else is looking to you, that's the only person you really need to consider: yourself, as an artist.</p><p></p><p>So good luck with it. And I hope you don't mind me saying so, but please wish your husband the best for me. Even though I don't know y'all, I'm pulling for you.</p><p></p><p>Rock and roll.</p>",

However, it also gives the impression that many of its projects are being shut down or defunded, which means that the people employed by those projects - and therefore not technically DTP employees - are losing their jobs as well. I'd be curious as to the actual numbers of those people, but I'd be surprised if even the DTP knows for sure, given their less-than-stellar organizational skills.</em>]</p><p></p><p>A lot of people have reached out to me today asking my opinion on the news that Las Vegas's Downtown Project is <a href=\"http://knprnews.org/post/tony-hsiehs-downtown-project-laying-employees\" target=\"_blank\">laying off 30% of its workforce</a>, and that <a href=\"http://recode.net/2014/09/30/tony-hsieh-steps-down-from-lead-role-at-las-vegas-downtown-project/?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social\" target=\"_blank\">Tony Hsieh seems to be actively distancing himself from it</a>. They want to know what I think because, for a few years, I was maybe <a href=\"https://t.co/9gO98x7BGQ\" target=\"_blank\">the most vocal critic</a> of what Hsieh was doing with downtown Vegas.</p><p></p><p>My immediate feeling is: it sucks to be right. My heart goes out to those folks who've been laid off and now have to figure out how they're gonna survive. I know that fear intimately, and wouldn't wish it on my worst enemies. I wish them very good luck.</p><p></p><p>Beyond that? Well, I am Jack's total lack of surprise. I warned people this was coming, for a long time, and very few people paid attention. I was very angry about what was happening downtown, but not because I thought the DTP was going to collapse. I mean, I <em>did</em>, and it seems I wasn't wrong, but my primary concern was with the collateral damage to both the existing Las Vegas cultural community and to the marginalized population of downtown. Unfortunately, despite all of my rage, things proceeded as planned: the poor people and existing small businesses were pushed out and replaced by whatever the hell Hsieh and his circle wanted to put in, like the Container Park, which is <a href=\"http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/nov/25/joe-downtown-container-park-opens-another-draw-eas/\" target=\"_blank\">neither a park nor made of shipping containers</a>.</p><p></p><p>So what can be learned from all of this? There are some pretty clear lessons here.</p><p></p><p><strong>1. Hire people who know what they're doing, not just people you like hanging out with. </strong>It's not much of a secret that Hsieh brought people into the DTP because he felt they were a \"culture fit\". Unfortunately, the culture in question was very much a frat bro party culture, which means that a lot of the people who got discretionary power over projects were, to put it mildly, not qualified for the jobs they found themselves in. And a lot of people who <em>were</em> competent who came in on projects were either marginalized out as not being \"good culture fits\" or left in disgust because their ability to do their jobs was limited by the useless idiots that they found themselves answering to.</p><p></p><p>That culture pervaded and continues to pervade a lot of the entire Vegas tech culture: startups that seem more like excuses for a bunch of bros to go and play witless giant board games at the Gold Spike and talk about marketing strategies for their awful ideas, rather than actually producing products that people would want. There are a lot of hard-working people in Vegas tech, to be sure, and some very bright ones...but very few of them were the ones actually making decisions, and their hard work and good ideas are stymied by the dipshits who are put in charge.</p><p></p><p>I've said it before, and I'll say it here: if you want your business to be successful, hire people who are good at their jobs and let them do their jobs. You may not want to be besties with them and do shots with them every night, but who gives a shit? As long as they do what they're supposed to do and are capable of working within your team, that's what you should be focusing on.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. Cities are not startups.</strong> Nor are they fucking Burning Man camps...but that's exactly what Downtown Vegas, as envisioned by the DTP, seemed to resemble. What the decision-makers seemed not to understand is that, rhetoric aside, <em>Burning Man is not a city</em>. It's not permanent. It couldn't be. There's a reason that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lamborn_Wilson\" target=\"_blank\">Hakim Bey</a> -- one of the people who influenced the whole initial culture of Burning Man -- called such places \"<a href=\"http://hermetic.com/bey/taz_cont.html\" target=\"_blank\">temporary autonomous zones</a>\". For all the talk of anarchy, Burning Man is a deliberate and very controlled environment, primarily made up of people who buy into the culture around it.</p><p></p><p>A <em>real</em> city like Las Vegas is far more chaotic, and filled with people who have absolutely no intention of getting with the program. And in a real city, you can't just throw those people out for not being cool, man, no matter how many <a href=\"http://www.fox5vegas.com/story/23857653/downtown-rangers-providing-security-service-to-las-vegas\" target=\"_blank\">Downtown Rangers</a> you hire to move the street bums and the crazies along. You can't just make those people <em>vanish</em>. In a city run by responsible people, there would be places for the people who were pushed aside by the DTP to go -- but Vegas is not a city run by responsible people, and a lot of those folks just ended up on the streets.</p><p></p><p>If you want to create sustainable private urban development, you need to understand the community you're operating in, and Hsieh never did, nor showed any real interest in learning. He just wanted to remake the city in his own image, and seemed surprised when the city didn't respond with the total slavish enthusiasm he anticipated.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. Coordination, realism, follow-through.</strong> Hsieh's people were constantly telling me that nobody was really in charge of everything, as if this was a <em>good</em> thing. But nobody seemed to know what anybody else was doing. It was disorganized and uncoordinated, and God knows how they handled the budgets for everything. (Today's news suggests: not very well.) And a lot of the initial visions were utterly unrealistic, or simply required a lot more money than anyone involved anticipated. Not because realistic budgets were hard to project, but because Hsieh didn't hire people who were capable of it. As a result of this, a lot of the announced projects just never materialized, or materialized in some half-assed form.</p><p></p><p>The Container Park is an excellent example of this: while I am a big fan and longtime advocate of reusing things like shipping containers in architecture, the fact is that Vegas is smack dab in the middle of the hottest desert in the Western Hemisphere; building a shopping mall out of steel boxes (and then, inexplicably, decking it out with <em>shiny metal outdoor furniture and metal children's playground equipment</em>) is therefore kind of a stupid idea. They would've done far better to build an Adobe Park. But the essential unworkability of that idea didn't seem to matter: they built it the way they wanted to -- or kinda sorta, since they didn't actually use real shipping containers for the majority of the space -- and then managed to run it in such a haphazard way that something like <a href=\"http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2014/apr/01/group-lauds-container-park-it-pulls-plug-3-shops-t/\" target=\"_blank\">a third of the occupants moved out within the first six months</a>. One of the original tenants told me that, due to the tinted storefronts, nobody could tell if her space was open; when she propped the door open to let people see that she was, they turned off her air conditioning.</p><p></p><p><strong>4. I do not think this word \"community\" means what you think it means.</strong> The Downtown Project was hammered so many times from so many quarters for their use of the word \"community\" -- by myself maybe loudest of all -- that <a href=\"http://www.vegasinc.com/business/2014/feb/07/joe-downtown-hsieh-says-downtown-project-not-chari/\" target=\"_blank\">they finally removed it from all of their statements</a>. And rightly so. Tony Hsieh  and his circle don't know the first fucking thing about what communities actually are, and what they need. It's not about building a bunch of douchey bars and hipster eateries for you and your bros to hang out in. It's not about turning a profit. It's about providing safe spaces and opportunities for everyone around you -- not just the people you personally like. Community is not about velvet ropes, it's about throwing the doors open and helping people to help themselves and thrive. You don't <em>tell</em> people how to build their community -- you <em>ask</em> them. And you <em>pay attention</em>, instead of co-opting people's ideas or ignoring people who are just as invested in the community as you are, or more so.</p><p></p><p>And that's exactly what the DTP did, time and time again. They alienated Vegas's existing cultural community and then pled, over and over: \"We're learning as we go along. We're making mistakes.\" So how many times do you need to make the same mistake before you learn from it, dummy? That is, of course, if you actually <em>recognize</em> that you've made a mistake, instead of assuming that you actually know best and other people can go along with your plan or get the fuck out. Which is, from what I can tell, what DTP's actual modus operandi was. Turns out that's not really the best way to do things, doesn't it?</p><p></p><p>The sad part about all of this is the very real collateral damage that's been inflicted on the lives of all those folks who're suddenly facing an uncertain future. But Tony Hsieh has proven, time and time again, that he doesn't give one single fuck about the collateral damage inflicted by his half-assed \"vision\", unless it directly affects his PR. But there's not enough spin in the world to make these layoffs go away. By all accounts, things have been spiraling out of control at DTP for a long time, but they've finally gone too far for anybody to finesse away or hide.</p><p></p><p>But the <em>worst</em> part is that none of this had to happen this way. Plenty of very smart people were telling Hsieh and everyone else involved in the DTP that they needed to change their tactics and strategies for a very long time. But they simply chose to assume that, because they'd run a successful shoe company, that they knew better than everybody else. So they ignored and condescended to a lot of people -- like me -- and fired the people whom they'd hired who didn't reinforce the idea that they were brilliant visionaries who were destined for success.</p><p></p><p>So fuck 'em. I left Vegas because this shit was way too depressing to be involved in anymore. Not my circus; not my monkeys. Except that a lot of my friends <em>are</em> still monkeys in that particular circus, and I'm worried about how the aftershocks of this will affect them, even the ones who didn't drink Hsieh's Kool-Aid.</p><p></p><p>Starting a tech community is a daunting task: after six months in Yakima with plans to try and do exactly that, I'm pretty discouraged myself. But I'm discouraged because there's no money for me to do it; when I think of what I could do here with a <em>hundredth</em> of the resources Hsieh had at his disposal, it makes me want to weep.</p><p></p><p>I certainly wouldn't botch things up the way he and his people have. I learned my lessons watching all of this unfold. And maybe the next swinging dick billionaire who decides to remake Las Vegas in their own image will too.</p>",

            "source": {
                "content": "<p>All the genuinely smart, talented, funny people I know seem to be miserable these days. You feel it on Twitter more than Facebook, because Facebook is where you go to do your performance art where you pretend to be a hip, urbane person with the most awesomest friends and the best relationships and the very best lunches ever. Facebook is surface; Twitter is subtext, and judging by what I've seen, the subtext is aching sadness.</p><p></p><p>I'm not immune to this. I don't remember ever feeling this miserable and depressed in my life, this sense of futility that makes you wish you'd simply go numb and not care anymore. I think a lot about killing myself these days. Don't worry, I'm not going to do it and this isn't a cry for help. But I wake up and think: <em>fuck, more of this? Really? How </em>much <em>more? And is it really worth it?</em></p><p></p><p>In my case, much of it stems from my divorce and the collapse of the next relationship I had. But that's not really the cause. I think that those relationships were bulwarks, charms against the dark I've felt growing in this world for a long time now. When I was in love, the world outside didn't matter so much. But without it, there is nothing keeping the wolf from the door.</p><p></p><p>It didn't used to be like this when I was a kid. I'm not getting nostalgic here, or pretending that my adolescence and my twenties were some kind of soft-focused Golden Age. Life sucked when I was young. I was unhappy then too. But there was always the sense that it was just a temporary thing, that if I stuck it out eventually the world was going to get better -- become awesome, in fact.</p><p></p><p>But the reality is that the three generations who ended the 20th century, the Boomers, their Generation X children, and Generation Y, have architected a Western civilization that's kind of a shit show. Being born in 1978, I fall at either the tail end of Gen X or the beginning of Gen Y, depending on how you look at it. I became an adolescent at the time Nirvana was ushering in a decade of \"slacker\" ideology, as the pundits liked to put it. But the reality is that I didn't know a whole lot of actual slackers in the 1990s. I <em>did</em> know a lot of people who found themselves disillusioned with the materialism of the 1980s and what we saw as the failed rhetoric of the Sixties generation, who were all about peace and love right until the time they put on suits and ties and figured out how to divide up the world. I knew a lot of people who weren't very interested in that path.</p><p></p><p>The joke, of course, is that every generation kills the thing they love. The hippies became yuppies; Gen X talked a lot about the revolution, and then went and got themselves some venture capital and started laying into place the oversaturated, paranoid world we live in now. A lot of them tried to tell themselves they were still punk as fuck, but it's hard to morally reconcile the thing where you listen to Fugazi on the way to your job where you help find new ways to trick people into giving up their data to advertisers. Most people don't even bother. They just compartmentalize.</p><p></p><p>And I'm not blaming them. The world came apart at the end of the 90s, when the World Trade Center did. My buddy Brent and I were talking about this one night last year -- about how the end of the 90s looked like revolution. Everybody was talking about Naomi Klein and anti-consumerism and people in Seattle were rioting over the WTO. Hell, <em>a major motion picture company </em>put out <em>Fight Club</em>, which is about as unsubtle an attack on consumer corporate capitalism as you can get. We were poised on the brink of something. You could feel it.</p><p></p><p>And then the World Trade Center went down. And all of a sudden calling yourself an \"anticapitalist terrorist\" was no longer a cool posture to psych yourself up for protest. It became something you might go to jail for -- or worse, to one of the Black Camps on some shithole island somewhere. Corporate capitalism became conflated somehow with patriotism. And the idea that the things you own end up defining you became quaint, as ridiculous spoken aloud as \"tune in, turn on, drop out\". In fact, it became a positive: if you bought the right laptop, the right smartphone, the right backpack, exciting strangers would want to have sex with you!</p><p></p><p>It's no wonder that Gen X began seeking the largely mythological stability of their forebearers; to stop fucking around and eating mushrooms at the Rage Against The Machine show, and to try and root yourself. Get a decent car -- something you can pass off as utilitarian -- and a solid career. Put your babies in Black Flag onesies, but make sure their stroller is more high tech than anything mankind ever took to the Moon, because that wolf is always at the door. And buy yourself a house, because property is always valuable. Even if you don't have the credit, because there's this thing called a \"subprime mortgage\" you can get now!</p><p></p><p>But the world changed again. And kept changing. So now you've got this degree that's worth fuck-all, a house that's worth more as scrap lumber than as a substantial investment, and you're either going to lose your job or have to do the work of two people, because there's a recession on. Except they keep saying the recession ended, so why are you still working twice as hard for the same amount of money?</p><p></p><p>We started two wars, only one of them even marginally justifiable, and thousands and thousands of people died. Some of them were Americans, most of them weren't. The world hated us again. It's psychically oppressive to realize you're the bad guy.</p><p></p><p>Of course, for a lot of the world, America had <em>always</em> been the bad guy...but we didn't really know that before, because we didn't have the Internet in our pocket, to be pulled out at every lunch break and before the meal came and when the episode of <em>Scrubs</em> on TV dragged a little, and before bed. We were encouraged to immerse ourselves in the endless flow of information, to become better informed, because knowing more about the world made us better people.</p><p></p><p>And maybe it did, but it also made us haunted people.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday morning, when I woke up, I clicked on a video in my Twitter feed that showed mutilated children being dragged from the streets of Gaza. And I started sobbing -- just sobbing, sitting there in my bed with the covers around my waist, saying \"Fuck, fuck, fuck,\" over and over to the empty room. Dead children, torn to bits. And then it was time for...what? Get up, eat my cereal, go about my day? <em>Every</em> day?</p><p></p><p>So you're haunted, and you're outraged, and you go on Twitter and you go on Facebook and you change your avatar or your profile picture to a slogan somebody thoughtfully made for you, so that you can show the world that you're watching, that you care, that it <i>matters</i>. But if you're at all observant, you begin to realize after a while that it <em>doesn't </em>matter; that your opinion matters for very little in the world. You voted for Obama, because Obama was about hope and change; except he seems to be mostly about hope and change for rich people, and not about hope at all for the people who are killed by American drones or who are locked away without trial in American internment camps or who are prosecuted because they stand up and tell the truth about their employers. There <em>does</em> seem to be a lot of hope and change in Fort Meade and Langley, though, where the NSA and CIA are given more and more leeway to spy on everyone in the world, including American citizens, not for what they've done but what they <em>might</em> do.</p><p></p><p>And the rest of the world? They keep making more dead children. They slaughter each other in the streets of Baghdad and Libya and Gaza and Tel Aviv; they slaughter each other in the hills of Syria; and, increasingly, they slaughter each other in American schools and movie theaters and college campuses.</p><p></p><p>And when you speak up about that -- when you write to your Congressperson to say that you believe in, say, stricter control on the purchase of assault weapons, or limiting the rights of corporations to do astonishing environmental damage, or not sending billions of dollars to the kind of people who think it's funny to launch missiles filled with flechette rounds into the middle of schools where children huddle together -- you're told that, no, <em>you're</em> the fascist: that people have the right to defend themselves and make money, and that those rights trump your right to not be killed by some fucking lunatic when you're waiting in line at Chipotle to grab a chicken burrito, and your right to not be able to light your tapwater on fire with a Zippo because of the chemicals in it, or not to end up in a grainy YouTube video while some demented religious fanatic hacks your head off with a rusty bayonet because your country -- not you, but who's counting -- is the Great Satan.</p><p></p><p>And the music sucks. Dear God, the music sucks. Witless, vapid bullshit that makes the worst airheaded wannabe profundities of the grunge era look like the collected works of Thomas Locke. Half the songs on the radio aren't anything more than a looped 808 beat and some dude grunting and occasionally talking about how he likes to fuck bitches in the ass. The other half are grown-ass adults singing about their stunted, adolescent romantic ideals and playing a goddamn washtub while dressed like extras from <em>The Waltons</em>.</p><p></p><p>The music sucks. The movies suck -- I mean, they didn't suck the first time they came out, in the 1980s, but the remakes and gritty reboots and decades-past-their-sell-by-date sequels suck. Indiana Jones is awesome, but nobody needs to see a geriatric Harrison Ford, lured out of retirement by the promise of building another mansion onto his mansion, running around with fucking <em>Shia LeBeouf</em> in the jungle. And besides, we're all media experts now; we can spot the merchandising nods from the trailer all the way to the final credits. There's no magic left. It's just another company figuring out a way to suck the very last molecules of profit out of the things we cherish, because that's what corporations do.</p><p></p><p>Everything is branded. Even people. People are \"personal brands\", despite the fact that, by and large, you can't figure out what most of them are actually even <em>good for</em>. They just exist to be snarky and post selfies and demand that you buy something, anything, with their picture on it.</p><p></p><p>You <em>actually know who Kim Kardashian is</em>. In an ideal world, you'd be as unaware of her existence as you are of the names of the Chinese kids who made the futurephone or featherweight laptop you're almost certainly reading this on. In an ideal world, Kim Kardashian would have spent her life getting sport-fucked anonymously by hip-hop stars in some Bel Air mansion, ran a salon, and either died of a coke overdose or Botox poisoning. There is no reason that her face and her life and her tits and her deathless thoughts needed to be foisted upon the world outside of the 90210 ZIP code. Except that somebody figured out that you could make money off showing people the car accident in slow motion, that people would watch that. Sure they will. People love to watch stupid people do stupid things. It makes them feel less stupid.</p><p></p><p>And the Internet.</p><p></p><p>We built this thing -- I include myself in that because I started doing HTML in 1994 and was part of the generation who took to the new medium like water and have made the majority of our adult lives creating it, to a greater or lesser degree -- because we believed it would make things better for everyone. We believed it would give voice to the voiceless, hope to the hopeless, bring us all together, help us to understand and empathize and share with one another. We believed it could tear down the walls.</p><p></p><p>And in a lot of ways it has. But in just as many ways, it has driven us all insane. There's an old story -- I have no idea if it's true -- about monkeys who had the pleasure centers of their brains wired up to a button. Push it, Mr. Monkey, and you have an orgasm. And the monkeys did. They pushed the button and they pushed the button, until they forgot about eating and they forgot about drinking and sleeping and simply fell down and died.</p><p></p><p>What do you do when you first wake up? What do you do as soon as you get into work? After work? Before bed? Hell, some of us wake up in the night and check our feeds, terrified that we've missed out on something.</p><p></p><p>We do it because we <em>are</em> given that reward, that stimulus that tells us <em>oooh, a new shiny</em>! It's the fourteenth <em>Guardians Of The Galaxy </em>trailer, with 200% more Rocket Raccoon! Some fucking null node in Portland made a portrait of every single character from <em>Adventure Time</em> out of bacon and Legos! And, maybe most poisonous, maybe most soul-crushing: <em>somebody said something I don't like that makes me feel frightened and threatened! It's time to put on my superhero costume and forward unto battle!</em></p><p></p><p>Except it doesn't matter. Because you're not really changing anybody's mind. How often does that little skirmish end with anybody changing their mind at all, even a little bit? Or does it just end with one of you invariably either blocking the other or saying something like \"You know what, I'm going to stop now, because this is getting out of hand.\"</p><p></p><p><em>Getting</em> out of hand?</p><p></p><p>Everything they told you about how to live in the world when you were a kid is a lie. Education doesn't matter, not even on paper. Being ethical doesn't matter. Being a good person doesn't matter. What matters now is that you're endlessly capable of the hustle, of bringing in that long green, of being entertaining to enough people that somebody will want to give you money or fuck you or fund your startup. We're all sharks now; if we stop swimming for just a little too long, we die. We lose followers. We're lame. We're not worth funding, or fucking. Because all that matters is the endless churn, the endless parade, the endless cycle of buying and trying to sell and being bought and sold by people who tell you that they're your friends, man, not like those others. Microsoft is evil and Google is not evil, except when they are, but that's not really important, and if you decide that maybe you're tired of being reduced to nothing more than a potential lead for a sales pitch, like something out of a fucking David Mamet play, then you're a hater and irrelevant and a Luddite. And besides, what would you do with yourself if you weren't checking Facebook or playing Candy Crush Saga or watching some teenage dumbass smash his genitals on the side of a pool on YouTube? What the fuck would you even <em>do</em>, bro?</p><p></p><p>The comedian Bill Hicks used to do a bit where he invited the advertisers and marketers in his audience to kill themselves. He imagined them turning it into an ad campaign: \"Oh, the righteous indignation dollar, that's a good dollar, Bill's smart to do that.\" He laid out the futility of trying to escape: \"I'm just caught in a fucking web,\" he'd say.</p><p></p><p>And that's where we are. You, me, we're trapped, between being nothing more than consumers, every aspect of our lives quantified and turned into demographic data, or being fucking Amish cavemen drifting into increasing irrelevancy. Because it really does feel like there's no middle ground anymore, doesn't it? There's no way to stay an active, informed citizen of the world without some motherfucker figuring out a way to squirm into your life to try and get a dollar out of you. Only fools expect something for free, and only bigger fools believe they're anything other than a consumable or a consumer.</p><p></p><p>We didn't get the William Gibson future where you can live like a stainless steel rat in the walls between the corporate enclaves, tearing at the system from within with your anarchy and your superior knowledge of Unix command lines. Now it's just pissed off teenagers who blame you because their lives are going to suck a cock and billionaire thugs trying to sell you headphones and handbags, all to a soundtrack of some waterhead muttering \"Bubble butt, bubble bubble bubble butt\" over and over while a shite beat thumps in the background.</p><p></p><p>I know a lot of people who privately long for an apocalypse of some kind, a breakdown of the ancient Western code, because then they'd either be dead or free. How fucking horrifying is that?</p><p></p><p>But nobody pulls that trigger, because now we've all seen what apocalypses look like. We saw Manhattan in 2001 and New Orleans in 2005 and Thailand in 2004 and the Middle East pretty much any given day. Nobody wants to hate, because we're pummeled with hate every day, by people who are too fucking stupid to understand that the world has passed them by as much as it's passed by the dude in the Soundgarden t-shirt who still drives around singing along to \"Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me!\" on his way to his dead-end job. The best lack all conviction, and the people who are full of passionate intensity? Fuck them. We're all sick of their shit anyway.</p><p></p><p>And that's where we are, and is it any goddamn wonder at all that the most profitable drugs sold in America for like a decade running have been antipsychotics? The <em>world</em> seems psychotic.</p><p></p><p>I feel like I need to figure this out, like figuring all of this out and finding new ways to live has become the most important thing I could possibly do, not just for myself and the people I love but for the entire human race. I don't mean me alone -- I'm far too self-loathing to have a messiah complex -- but I feel like, for me, this is the best use of my time. Because the world is making me crazy and sad and wanting to just put a gun in my mouth, and it's doing the same thing to a lot of people who shouldn't have to feel this way.</p><p></p><p>I don't believe anymore that the answer lies in more or better tech, or even awareness. I think the only thing that can save us is <em>us</em>. I think we need to find ways to tribe up again, to find each other and put our arms around each other and make that charm against the dark. I don't mean in any hateful or exclusionary way, of course. But I think like minds need to pull together and pool our resources and rage against the dying of the light. And I <em>do</em> think rage is a component that's necessary here: a final fundamental fed-up-ness with the bullshit and an unwillingness to give any more ground to the things that are doing us in. To stop being reasonable. To stop being <em>well-behaved</em>. Not to hate those who are hurting us with their greed and psychopathic self-interest, but to simply <em>stop letting them do it</em>. The best way to defeat an enemy is not to destroy them, but to make them irrelevant.</p><p></p><p>I don't have the answers. I don't know some truth that I can reveal to everyone. All I can do is hurt, and try to stop hurting, and try to help other people stop hurting. Maybe that's all any of us can do. But isn't that something worth devoting yourself to, more than building another retarded app that just puts more nonsense and bullshit into the world? Just finding people to love, and healing each other? I think it is.</p><p></p><p>Until I know more, I'll just keep holding on. I won't put the gun in my mouth. Because all of this sadness is worth it if there's still hope. And I want to still have hope so badly. I still want to believe, in myself, and in you.</p>",

                "content": "<p>Here's one thing we know, and know for sure: dumb matter and energy can become self-aware. How do we know? <em>Because we know</em>; because we are dumb matter and energy, and we are self-aware. <em>Si cogitationem mundo</em>: if we can think, the world can. The only question -- but boy, it's a doozy -- is <em>how</em>.</p><p></p><p>Is consciousness an inherent state of matter? In other words, if you arrange matter just so, can it become aware? If so, what is <em>just so</em>? What are the requirements for consciousness? Is it a function of the complexity of any feedback-capable system? In other words, if you make something that can input from the world and output back into it, and you make that thing's structure and capability complex enough, will it become conscious? Could you build a mind out of wood, powered by waterwheels? I don't think it's a stupid question, though it may seem stupid on the face of it. Because I keep coming back to the irrefutable fact that a bunch of soggy carbon powered by electrical impulses converted from the chemical energy stored in glucose can, in fact, not only become aware of itself, but write shitty pop songs. There is nothing exotic about the stuff our dreams are made of: we're complicated systems, sure, but there's no odd elements in our brains or bodies, no unobtanium. Most of the complex organisms on this planet are made of, by and large, the exact same chemicals in near-identical proportions.</p><p></p><p>And yet, we think. (I'm not saying that animals don't think, or aren't self-aware, because I think many of them are or approach that state, but purely from a Darwinian standpoint, they're not as good at it as we are; no other species has developed advanced language or the ability to store ideas beyond the lifetime of their creator, or at least insofar as we know, and I'm pretty sure we could recognize that sort of thing if it was there. I could be wrong. But it's a reasonable guess.)</p><p></p><p><span style=\"color: #181818;\">Alan Watts once said: “You are an aperture through which the universe is looking at and exploring itself.\" That is not mystical bullshit -- or rather, it's mystical, but it's not bullshit. One of the great benefits of psychedelics is that they can make you viscerally aware that there is no real distinction between you and the universe that you perceive as being outside of you, any more than there's a distinction between a tree and the ground it grows in. There is no barrier, no separation. You are simply a part of the continuum of the universe. And in that sense, Watts is absolutely correct: you and your mind are a node in the universe, through which it is experiencing itself.</span></p><p></p><p>To me, consciousness is all part of the Mystery: the infinite universe in which we exist, which we know so much and yet so little about. We can use telescopes to look backwards in time nearly to the beginning of the universe itself, and yet we are still so ignorant of how we ourselves work. We can guess at the composition of the heart of a star, but we haven't been able to work out how the photosynthesis that happens in the leaves of a house plant works well enough to create it for ourselves.</p><p></p><p>Of course, a lot of people have pointed this out...but for, I think, the wrong reasons. They use it as a sort of smug humility, a way of saying \"See? All your science is hubris.\" But that's just nonsense. We're not ignorant because we <em>can't </em>understand these things -- I believe the human mind's capacity for understanding is nearly infinite. We're ignorant because we haven't been doing this for very long at all. Shit, we're still less than three hundred years away from Isaac Newton. A thousand years ago, most humans thought the world was flat and the stars were termite holes in the floor of Heaven. The fact that we've come so very far so very fast is encouraging, even if we have so far to go.</p><p></p><p>The mysteries of the universe are exciting not because I believe they can't be solved, but because I believe that they <em>can</em>, and because I believe that doing so is the primary useful activity of the human species, and a lot of fun along the way.</p><p></p><p>More later.</p>",

                "content": "<p>I’ve spent the past week and a half in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakima,_Washington\">Yakima, Washington</a>. It’s a town in Central Washington with a population of around 93,000 in the city itself and almost a quarter million in the greater metropolitan area. The primary economy is agricultural: nearly <a href=\"http://www.usahops.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=hop_farming&amp;pageID=13\">80% of the hops used in beer production in the USA come from here</a>, and 40% of the entire world’s hops. It’s also a center for apple and cherry orchards and vineyards. It’s nestled in a valley from which, on a clear day, <a href=\"http://www.yakimawa.gov/media/snapshots/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/downtown-yakima/yakima-mt-adams2.jpg\">you can see Mount Adams rising above the hills</a>. Seattle is a two and a half hour drive across Snoqualamie Pass, and Portland is three and a half hours, across the Yakama Nation Reservation and through the gorgeous Columbia Gorge. The first brew pub in the world was in Yakima, and the town is famous for its wine, beer and fruit.</p><p></p><p>And hopefully, soon, it will be famous for tech. Effective immediately, I will be leaving Las Vegas and relocating here to Yakima, with a commitment to spend at least one year here. Initially, I will be working with a local company, <a href=\"http://www.appleseedmediagroup.com/\">Appleseed Media</a>, to help them create a new alternative weekly publication for the Yakima Valley, as both a writer and a developer for their online presence.</p><p></p><p>Once the publication is launched, I will continue to write for it...but my primary focus will be on establishing a startup to develop some of the online projects I’ve been attempting to put together for the last few years, as well as doing research and development into creating inexpensive, efficient technologies for the agricultural industry. This company will likely be called Cherry Blossom Industries, after the beautiful cherry blossoms that grow everywhere here. I am also working with local technologists and advisors, as well as potential investors, to potentially establish a tech angel fund in Yakima, to attract startups here, with a focus on (but not limited to) agricultural tech.</p><p></p><p>I will also be using my time in Yakima to complete my book <i>Digging For Fire</i>, about the technology industry in East Africa, which I had planned to have finished earlier this year, though it’s been delayed due to life stuff. I’ll also be blogging and documenting my experience building a startup here.</p><p></p><p>That explains what I’m doing. But the bigger question is: why?</p><p></p><p>The short answer is: I’ve been miserable for a long time, and I want to change that. Part of my misery is due to personal stuff and relationship bullshit, but most of it boils down to a couple of things:</p><p></p><p>1) I hate the tech industry as it exists right now, and</p><p>2) If I have to spend another year in Las Vegas I’ll put a gun in my mouth.</p><p></p><p>I’ve been in Las Vegas for fifteen years – long enough to see multiple waves of the supposed cultural renaissance that has been perpetually about to happen since the day I got to the city. And the fact is, there really <i>is</i> a renaissance happening now, thanks to the momentum generated by the Downtown Project and the revitalization of Fremont Street and the old downtown core.</p><p></p><p>The problem is, it’s precisely the renaissance that Las Vegas deserves. The new Downtown Las Vegas looks like what would happen if you took all the lifers from a psychopath ward, gave them selvedge denim and Warby Parkers and electroshock therapy and a half a billion dollars, and told them to recreate Portland, except without all the dirty poors and weirdos. It’s a wretched Baudrillardian <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreality\">hyperreality</a> of a culturally vibrant community. And it’s fractally goddamn stupid -- every <a href=\"http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/photos-life-cube-lights-downtown-las-vegas\">single</a> <a href=\"http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/05/joe-downtown-run-dont-walk-fire-breathing-praying-/\">individual</a> facet of it is just as goddamn stupid as the whole thing, which is <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/shard/s10/sh/cb5049c0-54e7-477a-92a8-2f49e1fffbf2/96832700c99f170c665364a3414cf92a\">monumentally, colossally goddamn stupid</a>. No wonder it’s <a href=\"http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/column/joe-downtown/2014/apr/02/signs-enthusiasm-new-downtown-started-to-fade/\">already beginning to hemorrhage goodwill and momentum</a>...which will tend to happen if you leave the redevelopment of a city to a bunch of incompetent self-promoting chancers who would rather get day drunk at the Gold Spike and play giant board games than actually consider the <a href=\"http://racked.com/archives/2014/02/28/zappos-ceos-renovation-of-downtown-vegas-angers-locals.php\">long-term implications</a> of any of their <a href=\"http://downtowncontainerpark.com/\">half-baked ideas</a>, much less bring them to completion. (Long-term implications like what might happen if you were to build a shopping mall out of poorly insulated steel shipping containers, with outdoor furniture made of polished bare metal and a children's playground made out of steel equipment, in the middle of the hottest desert in the Western Hemisphere. Y'all have fun when summer kicks into high gear. Make sure to keep the first aid kits handy for the burn victims.)</p><p></p><p>Las Vegas is a city that is entirely and utterly about money, to the exclusion of anything else, and it makes its money by luring sociopaths and hucksters and developers with the souls of Barbary Coast whoremongers, and gives them the keys to the kingdom.</p><p></p><p>There are some remarkable people in Vegas, good people and smart people and talented people, many of whom I respect deeply and many of whom I love with all my heart; and they are almost all of them one step away from poverty and mired in depression at their inability to get anything done. They are marginalized by the people with money and treated with condescension and contempt by the local government. Just like me.</p><p></p><p>After fifteen years of hoping and trying to change Las Vegas, I am sick in my soul of it. The city is driving me to suicide, and I mean that literally. Though I love and adore my family and the self-created family of amazing people I have built in those years, I can’t take it anymore.</p><p></p><p>I had already decided to leave when my friend Goldie invited me to visit Yakima, where she had recently moved. I came up here expecting nothing but a week of relaxation. Instead, what I found was a blank canvas.</p><p></p><p>Yakima has everything I need to live and be happy, or at least as much as Las Vegas has: all the necessary retail and services, a couple of kick ass dive bars, and it’s a hell of a lot closer to <a href=\"http://www.powells.com/\">Powell’s Books</a> in Portland, which is where I want to go when I die, than Las Vegas is. And it has a few unique features that make it ideal for what I want to do.</p><p></p><p>For one thing, Yakima is <i>cheap</i>. I normally don’t feel comfortable talking about money in public, but I’ll put it to you this way: I did the math, and at the rates I charge for doing web design and development, I can afford to rent (or buy) a five bedroom farmhouse and cover all of my expenses by working approximately four days a month.</p><p></p><p>Let me repeat that. <i>Four days a month</i>.</p><p></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">If I chose to live in a smaller place -- say, the size of where I live in Vegas -- I could cut that back to two days a month. But I’m fine with that extra labor, really I am. And the work is there, for me, both from outside contracts and from local businesses who need coding and other tech work done. </span></p><p></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">What does that mean for me in real terms? It means I can devote the majority of my time to the project I want to work on: my book, my other writing...and all of the really cool technology ideas I’ve been keeping on the back burner for years.</span></p><p></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">It also allows me to start doing something I’ve been wanting to do for a while, which is to devote a large part of my time to researching and developing technologies targeted at working class people and the global economic base of the pyramid. One of the areas I plan to work in here is agricultural technology. Even in the past ten days, I’ve identified several key areas in agriculture – water irrigation, climate monitoring, and pesticide delivery – which are, if you’ll forgive the pun, ripe for innovation. And there is a lot of money here for that sort of thing. I’ve already been talking to potential investors, and literally every day I’m here I meet more people in the agricultural sector whose eyes light up when I tell them even my simplest, most rudimentary ideas.</span></p><p></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">And this is why I also want to put together an angel investment fund here that will offer seed money to startups, with the provision that they spend at least eighteen months in Yakima. From a purely financial standpoint, it makes sense to do a startup here. The cost of commercial real estate here is </span><i style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">nothing</i><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">. If I wanted to rent an entire building the size of the Emergency Arts building in Vegas, it would cost me roughly $1500 a month. That’s </span><i style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">fifteen hundred dollars a month</i><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">. I’m already talking to one local businessman who wants to turn one of his properties into a tech incubator. And the cost of living is absurd.</span></p><p></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">But does it make sense from a business perspective? Not according to an angel fund investor I met with in Portland. “Why would anybody want to live in Yakima,” he said, “when they can go to San Francisco and make $250K a year?”</span></p><p></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">But I think, with all due respect, that he’s wrong. (My response was: \"Because they don't want to spend $100K of that on rent and parking.\") I think he’s not seeing a large but nearly invisible demographic of the tech industry: people like me, who aren’t interested anymore in spending $2500 a month on a tiny studio in the Outer Mission, and spending all our time networking like lunatics and busting our asses just to eke out an existence, working for venture capitalists for whom we are just replaceable cogs in a money machine; people who want to get out of the bubble and just </span><i style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">work</i><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">, on things they care about, in a beautiful place where they can live like humans and not worker drones. Not everybody wants to play at being Mark Zuckerberg. Some of us just want to make amazing things that make people’s lives better, and be happy.</span></p><p></p><p>There's an entire generation of folks who are <a href=\"http://www.newrepublic.com/article/117088/silicons-valleys-brutal-ageism\">ignored and treated with scorn by the tech industry</a>: people in their mid-thirties to late forties who got into the Internet on the ground floor in the 90s. And while many of us are still technologically relevant and full of both ideas and experience, we're treated like senile fools by the tech industry, despite the fact that <a href=\"http://business.time.com/2013/03/14/ask-the-expert-the-best-age-for-a-start-up-founder/\">high-growth startups are more likely to be run by CEOs in their fifties than in their twenties</a>. But the tech industry loves twentysomething kids with no attachments and no life experience. Why? Because they'll work like indentured servants for catered lunches and Nerf gun wars in the office, and the promise of becoming instant billionaires.</p><p></p><p>Look, I've been doing this for a really long time, and I'll let you in on a secret: I know about the same number of people who've <a title=\"They don't look a thing like Jesus.\" href=\"http://www.thekillersmusic.com/home\">become millionaires from playing rock and roll</a> as I do who've become millionaires by building startups.</p><p></p><p>There are plenty of incredibly talented, driven people who simply aren't interested in playing the Silicon Valley <a href=\"http://www.lyricsfreak.com/g/guided+by+voices/game+of+pricks_20062917.html\">game of pricks</a>; people with families, people who value quality of life over running an endless race to which many are called and very few are chosen; people who aren't driven by the lure of lunatic wealth, but by the desire to do good work and make a living from it.</p><p></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">And, I mean, it’s not like we have a global communications network that allows us to be in constant contact with anybody in the world, right? Plus it’s a $270 round-trip flight out of Yakima Airport to San Francisco, less if you’re willing to make the beautiful drive to Portland or Seattle. Being in Yakima is really not much more remote than being in a second-tier urban area like Vegas or Austin or Kansas City.</span></p><p></p><p>My vision is of a small hub here, working out of <a href=\"http://www.knightfoundation.org/media/uploads/project_rotator_images/479617858_e4cbff89ba_z.jpg.640x360_q85_crop.jpg\">the beautiful buildings in downtown Yakima</a>, maybe building affordable tech for the agriculture sector, maybe based around organic food or alcohol or even cannabis. People volunteering to teach tech classes for the Native Americans on the reservation or the Hispanic agricultural workers who make up 54% of the population here, people who work to make water usage more efficient, people who work to build technologies that we can share with and sell to the entire world. People who would rather devote themselves to the work they love rather than the work they have to do just to get by LA or San Francisco or New York. People who want to genuinely build a community and build the future, not just get rich and peace out.</p><p></p><p>So that’s why I’m coming here, and that’s what I want to build. And I want you to help me do it. Once I’m established and I begin putting together this tech fund, I’d like to host my friends and acquaintances from Vegas and elsewhere who’d like to come to Yakima and see if they share my vision. (You didn’t think I really needed <i>five bedrooms</i> just for myself, did you?) If you’re one of these folks, get in touch and we’ll figure out how to make it happen.</p><p></p><p>I will miss my friends and family in Vegas, but I really, truly believe this is the best possible thing I could do for myself right now...and even the thought of it fills me with a hope and joy I haven’t felt in years. I’ve wanted to change the world for my entire life; I think I can do it here.</p><p></p><p>Check you on the flip side.</p>",

                "content": "<p>I'm going to maybe expand this into an actual piece of journalism soon, but I just wanted to write down some thoughts here.</p><p></p><p>Why do techies -- or, really, any well-to-do demographic -- feel the urge to move into the place that poor people live and then change it? To tear down the crappy little mini-marts or local bars or check cashing places and turn them into boutique grocery outlets and craft cocktail bars and meaningful retail experiences?</p><p></p><p>I moved to San Francisco in 1996 as an aspiring art student and novice web designer. Due to economics, I ended up in the Tenderloin, living on Market Street between 6th and 7th. My apartment was tiny and cramped, I shared a bathroom with everyone on my floor, and the neighborhood was often bewildering and frightening. One night, after seeing a car get Molotoved in front of my place, I felt like Tom Hanks in <i>Big</i>, terrified of the big city around me.</p><p></p><p>And yet, my first urge was not to improve the Tenderloin, as seems to be the wont of the techies who've moved into it a generation later. I wanted to <i>understand</i> my scary new neighborhood. I wanted to learn to live in it, to be tough. I didn't need the Club Charleston, the bar around the corner where the local poor artists and residents of nearby residential hotels gathered, to serve me exquisite cocktails served in glasses forged from Icelandic volcanic glass; I wanted to be the kind of cool guy who could walk into a place like the Club Charleston and make it my own. (Never happened. But I was a nineteen year old art student who wanted to build virtual reality art sculptures. I was not cool.)<i></p><p></i></p><p></p><p>Of course, I was poor. I had no choice but to live in the 'Loin or someplace equally as shitty. And in retrospect, my tenure in the cracked-out urban ghetto of San Francisco was one of the most important formative experiences I ever had. I couldn't change the 'Loin, but the 'Loin changed me.</p><p></p><p>That's the difference: the people who are moving into places like the Tenderloin or Downtown Las Vegas are not poor. They don't <i>have</i> to be living in the hood. But they choose to...and then they decide to remake the hood in their own image, instead of embracing it, augmenting it without demolishing it, integrating with their less-affluent new neighbors instead of just walking in and kicking the fucking door down and dictating terms to people who are neither wealthy nor politically connected enough to really argue with them. And those people, most of whom do not have the luxury of trading places with the techies and moving to Sunnyvale or Mountain View -- or, in the case of Las Vegas, Summerlin or Green Valley, where Zappos' former HQ is -- get pushed out of the downmarket, low-rent places that in many cases have been their home for decades.</p><p></p><p>Why? Is this some quest for authenticity? Or just a land grab, a way of buying low and selling high? In the case of San Francisco, it seems like some sort of fetishism for exposed brick on the parts of the yuppie nerds who've swarmed the city. In the case of Downtown Las Vegas, it looks like a halfwitted experiment in New Urbanism, scribbled on the back of a cocktail napkin by some blissed-out molly-gobbler who read the Wikipedia entry on Jane Jacobs once. It's the opposite of the white flight of the latter half of the 20th century; it's white incursion.</p><p></p><p>What I find really laughable and contemptible is when these New Urbanistas have the gall to complain about the places they've voluntarily inhabited. The new Container Park on Fremont Street has security guards out front to keep the shifty Negroes and tweaker trash away from the meaningful retail experience therein. SF techies write posts about how appalling it is to have to be within fifty feet of somebody who smells weird and, like, doesn't even have a Snapchat account. <i>Ewwwwww.</i></p><p></p><p>(Watching rich nerds get skeeved out by poor people is one of my favorite pastimes, actually. I like to sit out front of the Emergency Arts building at 6th and Fremont here in Vegas and watch what happens when some douchey social media fuck on their way to a big meeting at the Beat with a venture capitalist actually has to interact with a poor. It's sad and hilarious at the same time.)</p><p></p><p>The thing is: <i>nobody forced you to come down here, bro</i>. The people who live in these poor places are not excited by the economic development you keep parroting whenever anybody accuses you of being a gentrifier. Does Twitter moving to the Tenderloin actually equal jobs for the people who live there? No; not even indirectly. When you tear down the old kebab shop downstairs, you're not hiring their staff to man your new artisanal ham sandwich place; you're hiring people with grad degrees and exquisite tattoos. Hell, you're not even buying your drugs from the local dealers; you're still getting that high grade cheeba brought in from the 'burbs.</p><p></p><p>You're not improving a neighborhood by moving to it; you're erasing it and replacing it with your own idea of what a community should be...and it's my experience that techies understand the idea of \"community\" as well as they understand the ideas of \"restraint\" and \"taste\", which is to say about as well as my lazy-eyed cat understands von Neumann game theory. Certainly what exists in Downtown Las Vegas is not a community as I understand the word. It's largely a slavering pack of vapid, desperate graspers whose greatest aspiration in life is to live in the Ogden and get invited to tour Tony Hsieh's apartment, and who devote themselves entirely to establishing their own personal brands by being seen getting shitfaced at the right bars by the right people. It's business networking masquerading as human contact, in a newly constructed kiddie playpen for the secretly alcoholic and the severely personality deficient. And all of the businesses and economic development that have been generated there -- both bricks and mortar and virtual -- reflect that, with merciless accuracy and precision.</p><p></p><p>There's an alternate world version of these places that I can see in my head clear as day: a place where the rich folks actually bothered to engage with the poor folks, and made even the slightest effort to try and use their affluence to bring everyone up, rather than tearing down the businesses, residences and lives of those people who were simply going about trying to survive with very little in the way of resources. A world where the long and rich history of the Tenderloin was recognized and respected, not bulldozed in an attempt to build a whitewashed douchebag terrarium called Mid-Market. A place where Downtown Las Vegas had new homeless shelters and community centers, where the tech community gave more than token lip service to reaching out to the at-risk and disadvantaged, where care was taken to engage with and provide space for not only the well-to-do, but for the working class who serves their stupid cocktails and their Mongolian sliders and makes the art they all claim to care so much about.</p><p></p><p>Those communities would be valuable, economically diverse, and productive. <i>Those</i> communities I'd be excited to see, and be a part of.</p>",

Apparently someone complained about one of my posts, claiming that it violated your Community Standards. I reviewed those guidelines at length and determined that the post very clearly and unambiguously violates none of them.</p><p></p><p>The post was a parody bit about Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr, on his eponymous holiday. I was making fun of all of the people posting either sanctimonious quotes from Dr. King -- whom I hold in the highest regard -- or links claiming that Dr. King was far more militant than he actually was, pretending that I was writing a movie about a hard-drinking, hard-fighting version of Dr. King entitled Inglorious Paster. (A play on the Tarantino film Inglorious Basterds, if I actually need to explain that.) It is certainly a vulgar and profane bit of humor, but that's all it is. A joke.</p><p></p><p>The entire text of the post follows, between the lines.</p><p></p><p>-----</p><p></p><p>\"Man, fuck all of you. As soon as I'm done with this bottle of Creepin' Jesus I'm gonna come down there and kick the fucking soul out of each and every one of you cracker sons of bitches, and then I'm gonna find Robert E Lee's grave, and I'm gonna piss that Creepin' Jesus all over it, and then I'm gonna come back and fuck your women. Correctly. And if Detroit Red over there has jack shit to say about it, he can come over here while I'm handling your women the way you honky motherfuckers never had the inches to, and he can help support the weight of my big old balls with his chin. Hey, looks like this Creepin' Jesus is just about done.\"</p><p></p><p>-- Dr. Martin Luther King</p><p></p><p>-----</p><p></p><p>Now, I have reviewed your Community Standards, and I can go through them one by one.</p><p></p><p>Violence And Threats -- clearly this is not a threat of violence. It's a fictional bit of absurd dialogue from a historical figure who is in fact dead.</p><p></p><p>Self-Harm -- Does not apply.</p><p></p><p>Bullying and Harassment -- Again, fiction, joke, not aimed at any actual person or group.</p><p></p><p>Hate Speech -- Okay...here is your exact wording: \"Facebook does not permit hate speech, but distinguishes between serious and humorous speech.\" This post is very, very clearly intended to be humorous. Whether you or any individual personally find it funny or not is not the point. This is very obviously meant to be a joke. It is ludicrous and over the top.</p><p></p><p>You go on to say: \"While we encourage you to challenge ideas, institutions, events, and practices, we do not permit individuals or groups to attack others based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability or medical condition.\" This post was explicitly meant to, as you say, challenge ideas and institutions. I am not attacking anyone in it, unless you believe that I am somehow seriously attacking white people, of which I am one. If a reader inferred that, I chalk it up to a fairly serious incapacity to understand the difference between reality and fantasy on their part, but that is hardly my problem.</p><p></p><p>(It's excruciating having to explain the joke here, but I want to be very clear.)</p><p></p><p>Graphic Content -- While the language is indeed graphic, you make explicit reference to images, not words. You also say: \"When people share any content, we expect that they will share in a responsible manner.\" I consider posting a comedy bit to my timeline -- shared only, as far as I know, with people who have voluntarily chosen to be my Facebook friends -- a responsible manner of sharing it.</p><p></p><p>Nudity and Pornographic Content -- While the post has crude sexual humor in it, I think it's clear it's not pornographic by any reasonable definition of that word. Also, as it is prose and not imagery, there is no actual nudity.</p><p></p><p>None of the remaining standards you display -- Identity and Privacy, Intellectual Property, Phishing and Spam and Security -- are applicable.</p><p></p><p>I believe that by allowing some anonymous person to control what I say on my private timeline, when that speech does not violate any of the terms you have explicitly set for usage of your service, you're establishing a dangerous precedent. What happens if I just don't like what someone else says? Can I flag their post, thereby automatically removing it and earning them a time-out in the corner, like some disobedient child?</p><p></p><p>You have every right to manage your community as you see fit, but I respectfully ask that you take a moment to consider how you go about doing that.</p><p></p><p>I don't really believe that you will actually reinstate my post, or apologize for temporarily banning me when I've done nothing that violates the rules you set for me. If you even bother to respond to me at all, I expect it to be a repetition of the notification you already gave me about this post, with no clarification or explanation of why the post was removed and my account temporarily suspended. You are a corporation, after all, and corporations are not very good at accepting responsibility for their decisions, hiding behind legalese and the most cautious and noncommittal of communications.</p><p></p><p>But I do believe that free speech, and the boundaries which we place upon it, do matter. Otherwise I wouldn't waste my time writing you this message.</p><p></p><p>Thanks for your time. See you whenever my account suspension is suspended.</p><p></p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Josh Ellis</p>",

            "source": {
                "content": "<p><em>[Update: a clarification here, based on thoughtful feedback: this idea is something I discussed extensively with local tech people in Nairobi when I was there. All of them were very enthusiastic and excited about this idea. I don't want to give the impression of, as one commenter put it, White Saviorism. Kenyans do not need honkies to teach them the way. They are badasses. I simply want to share the benefit of America's tech scene's longer </em>practical<em> experience with building startups.]</em></p><p></p><p>So I've got a clever scheme, and I'd like your feedback as to whether you'd support this financially (via crowdfunding) or in other ways.</p><p></p><p>I want to arrange to bring a group of Americans to Nairobi, Kenya, to do a six-week intensive sort of bootcamp on how to run a startup project. (Not how to run a startup <em>business</em>, which is not my specialty, but how to run a project, commercial or nonprofit.) The idea is to bring people in four categories – programmers, project managers, UI/UX designers and system/server admins – who would help teach their Kenyan counterparts the practicalities of actually building projects from conception to launch. Two weeks would be intensive classes, and four weeks would be dedicated to building a specific community-based project, to be determined by a panel of people (probably including, among others, myself and Jimmy Gitonga from iHub, whom I've spoken to about this), which would have value to the Nairobi tech community or larger community at large.</p><p></p><p>This would <em>not</em> be a class for learning how to code, design, etc. Students would be expected to be at least intermediate in their respective fields. This class would be rather to teach practical, on-the-ground stuff -- the quickest and cheapest way to deploy servers, free tools for project management and how to use them, best practices for handling customer support, etc.</p><p></p><p>It is my experience, visiting Nairobi, that the people who comprise Kenya's tech scene are well-educated, smart as hell, and capable of hustling in ways that a lot of American tech people could learn a lot from. The only thing we really have on them, over here, is just <i>experience</i>: we've been doing this a lot longer and we have a lot lower barrier to gathering information and collaborating, as we simply are more familiar with what's out there. Kenyans have access to the same Internet we do, but they're not necessarily versed in <em>where</em> to look for information. And they don't always know the quick-and-dirty tricks we know.</p><p></p><p>I would get volunteers to teach the classes. They would be unpaid, but their expenses for travel would be paid, they would be hosted for room and board by local nerds in Nairobi, and we'd arrange a per-diem for them to cover other expenses. We'd also arrange fun field trips and the like on weekends, to make the experience a meaningful and awesome one. The students would not have to pay, but would apply for the classes and be chosen based on their experience, etc.</p><p></p><p>I would like to do this during the Northern Hemisphere summer, sometime between May and September, after I finish my book about tech in East Africa. I've got people in Nairobi willing to help arrange the practicalities and do the legwork there, and everyone I spoke to there about this sounded genuinely excited about the possibilities. I've also got folks on this side of the pond who are interested in helping me with logistics, assembling a curriculum, and volunteering to be teachers as well.</p><p></p><p>In addition, I'd like to work with students to become teachers after completing the course, so that this could continue without needing to bring folks over every time, or as many. I'd like this to be an ongoing project, maybe quarterly or every six months.</p><p></p><p>I'd like to raise the money for the expenses (airfare, materials, etc.) using crowdfunding or corporate sponsorship, which I have no ethical problem with in this case. I haven't crunched the numbers, but my guess is it'd probably run about $40-50K, depending upon how many teachers we eventually brought over, etc.</p><p></p><p>Is this something you'd be interested in supporting or being involved in? Would you throw a few bucks our way? Do you have suggestions or criticisms? If so, let me know on Twitter (@jzellis) or Facebook.</p>",

                "content": "<p>It's New Year's Day of 2014, and I'm feeling confessional. (Not in the legal or moral sense, more in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessional_poetry\">the poetic sense</a>.)</p><p></p><p>I get the impression that I am widely regarded, by those who know me and those who follow my work and my social network postings, as an angry person. I can't really deny that, I suppose. Being an angry person has become deeply unfashionable, these days; when <a href=\"http://recoveringyogi.com/count-me-out-of-the-positivity-cult/\">the cult of positivity</a> reigns supreme over (at least) American West Coast culture, a surly motherfucker such as myself stands out like the drunk asshole at a rave.</p><p></p><p>Of course, things are more complicated than they would appear to be. I am, in my personal life, a generally peaceable person: despite what you might think if you only know me through my writing or the public persona I seem to have generated, I am generally a polite, non-confrontational person. In many ways, tools like Twitter serve as safety valves for the rage that often hits me. I say horrible shit on Twitter so that I don't say them in real life.</p><p></p><p>But I <em>am</em> an angry person, there's no doubt. But I don't think many people -- especially people who are focused on positivity as a force for change -- understand <em>why</em> I'm angry, why anger has always been a very literal survival mechanism for me. If you're someone who cares enough about who I am as a person to be curious about this, I figured I'd maybe provide some insight, even if it's highly unreliable and subjective.</p><p></p><p>When I was about two years old, maybe two and a half, my mother was pushing me in my stroller at a swap meet in North Texas, where we lived, when she realized a woman was following her, focusing on me with a particularly intensity. It frightened her, until the woman came up and introduced herself as a child development researcher from the University of North Texas. She told my mother that she'd noticed me pointing at signs around the swap meet and reading them aloud. Did I do this a lot, she wondered?</p><p></p><p>My mom shrugged. Sure, she said. She assumed it was normal. (My mother was barely old enough to legally drink at the time.)</p><p></p><p>The woman assured her it wasn't, and asked if my mom would bring me into UNT to be tested, which she did -- she told me later that she sat there all day, listening to me occasionally crying from within the office where the woman and her colleagues were doing whatever they were doing to me.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the woman came out, and told my mother that they'd like to keep me for further observation. It worried my mom. Was there something wrong with me, she asked?</p><p></p><p>Quite the opposite, the woman said. It turned out that, according to their tests, my IQ was completely off the upper end of the chart. I was some kind of weird mental mutant, and they wanted to basically figure out what the hell was going on with my brain. But the whole situation creeped my mother out, and she politely declined.</p><p></p><p>I grew up in a very odd way; probably the closest media depiction to my childhood I've ever seen is the 1991 Jodie Foster film <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Man_Tate\" target=\"_blank\">Little Man Tate</a>. Mom was, mostly, a young single mother who worked a series of low-paying gigs as a waitress or caterer or music critic while she focused on her career as a singer/songwriter. We lived in shitty little houses in shitty parts of town. The first time I saw someone murdered was when we lived in the Dallas suburb of Addison, thanks to some sort of gang fight in the front yard of our apartment; I must've been about four years old. Later, we became semi-nomadic, living in Tennessee, Montana and Wyoming, as well as various spots around North Texas.</p><p></p><p>My grandparents, however, were...I'm not sure I'd say they were <em>rich</em>, but they were definitely upper middle class at the least, and there were probably times when my grandfather cleared over a million dollars in the 1980s, including investments. They took a very active interest in my development, and though my mom did not very often take their money, she allowed them to pay for my education.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, I mainly attended private schools until eighth grade -- Montessori schools and British style prep schools, where I was surrounded by the offspring of Texas's economic elite, the scions of vast oil and ranching fortunes. Every morning, my mother would drive me from whatever downtrodden 'hood we lived in to these schools, which often had ivy carefully planted to grow up their red brick walls and where the boys and girls wore uniforms and school trips were to Aspen for skiing instead of some nearby state park for S'mores and campfires.</p><p></p><p>I get the impression that I often attended these schools on some kind of scholarship, due to my IQ scores, which were routinely above 180 on the old <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_classification#Wechsler_Intelligence_Scales\" target=\"_blank\">Wechsler scale</a>. I was reading at a high school level by the time I was around six years old, when my favorite books were C.S. Lewis's <em>Chronicles Of Narnia</em>, which was also the time when I first began writing simple BASIC programs on the Commodore VIC-20 my grandfather bought me; when I was nine, I fell in love with Douglas Adams and Stephen Hawking; when I was ten, I read <em>It</em> by Stephen King for the first time. Since very early childhood, I've been a speed reader, averaging between 500-1500 words per minute, depending on the complexity of the text. I have no sense of needing to <em>comprehend</em> text, or even a lag between seeing a word and understanding it -- I read as fast as my eyes can move. There's no translation between character and concept in my head. Even as a child, the only time I remember having to spell out words was when I was around three or four.</p><p></p><p>Child prodigies usually follow a pretty standard path in life: chess and classical music lessons, advanced science or math, off-the-charts academic achievement. And that was definitely the direction my grandparents pushed me in. They bought me chessboards, paid for violin lessons, bought me the latest computers. When they had parties, they would get me to come out and deliver mini-lectures to their friends about the books I'd read, like some kind of fucking trained animal.</p><p></p><p>The problem, though, was that all of my intelligence lay in what people often erroneously call \"right-brained\" activities. Chess bored me; I was crap at violin; I was fascinated by the concepts of astrophysics but I was utterly uninterested in the math. I liked writing text adventure games, but I couldn't wrap my brain around the rigorous side of coding. I hated puzzles and brain teasers. I was more interested in writing fantasy stories or little songs. I was useless at all the little feats of prodigy. I was endlessly verbal but not especially analytical. I loved playing with Legos and using my G.I. Joes to make up stories about heroism and sacrifice, but I got quickly bored with the microscopes and other science toys my grandparents would buy me. I'd lose the extra lenses and the little bottles of dye for staining samples.</p><p></p><p>I was also an awkward, irritating child. I talked constantly, and because I couldn't speak as fast as I could think, my words fell all over each other, my drawl making me nearly unintelligible. Most adults found me irritating -- and because I was completely uninterested in the hallmark obsessions of 1980s Texas childhood, like monster trucks and the Cowboys and Garbage Pail Kids and WWF wrestling, other kids just hated me.</p><p></p><p>I cannot remember a time when I was not deeply depressed. Even as a child, I was intuitive enough to be aware that I was completely socially hopeless and something of a disappointment to my family -- especially my grandfather, who was a self-made and driven electrical engineer who constantly reminded me of my failure to live up to my potential, which seemed to him a terrible waste of the money he was spending on my education.</p><p></p><p>I also can't remember the first time someone punched me in the face.</p><p></p><p>I was badly bullied from preschool right up until the day I walked out of high school, my junior year, never to return. I was called names and mocked, of course, but I was also physically abused by my peers, punched and kicked and slapped on a regular basis. Hardly a week went by when I wasn't physically assaulted to some degree; and each school year, I could expect at least one fairly hardcore beating, which of course got more serious as time progressed. I got my first broken nose when I was thirteen, from a girl I'd never met before, at a house party; I still have no idea what I did to earn it. Riding home on my bike from my eighth grade prom, some drunk rednecks ran me off the road, ruining the suit I'd borrowed from my great-grandfather for the occasion; and I've<a href=\"http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/2013/01/righteous-kill/\" target=\"_blank\"> written elsewhere on this blog about my experiences with guns</a>.</p><p></p><p>If you're wondering why no one in a position of authority intervened in this, why no adults stepped in...well, the fact is that most of the faculty in the schools I attended probably loathed me as much as their students. I was a smart-ass know-it-all kid who never, <em>ever</em> had any respect of any kind for arbitrary authority. I was constantly disruptive in class, because I was almost always bored out of my mind. Some of those teachers and administrators were better at hiding their dislike than others; some of them were pretty open about it. I remember the first time I really understood that, sitting across from the principal of my school -- being aware that I wasn't just a professional irritation to him, but that he actively disliked me as a human. It made me feel like I had nothing to protect me from the world's sharpest edges.</p><p></p><p>And so I was miserable. I was so miserable, in fact, that at the age of eleven, my family sent me to a therapist, who promptly put me on first <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amitriptyline\" target=\"_blank\">Elavil</a>, and then <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication)\" target=\"_blank\">lithium</a>, after the Elavil caused me to go on unprovoked, uncontrollable crying jags.</p><p></p><p>I think that was around the time that I began to hurt myself in earnest, bashing my head into walls.</p><p></p><p>That was also the year I got expelled from my first school, for fighting with one of the teachers' kids: he hit me and ran away, and I chased after him, screaming obscenities at the top of my lungs. (Remember, I was by this time an avid Stephen King fan, and this provided me the kind of vocabulary that you might imagine.) I think when I caught him I tried to beat him up, but of course I was useless at it.</p><p></p><p>It didn't matter who started it, of course;  what mattered was that I was the one who got caught, who disturbed the peace. I was angry at being hit, but I was even angrier because it <em>wasn't fucking fair</em>.</p><p></p><p>I think I remember the moment at which my perpetual dogged sadness became something different. After my expulsion, my scandalized grandparents made it clear that they were done with trying to provide me with an excellent education: I was on my own.</p><p></p><p>So eighth grade was the Gee School in Pilot Point, Texas -- a good old-fashioned junior high with good old-fashioned approaches to dealing with freaks like me. Including, as it turned out, corporal punishment.</p><p></p><p>I can't remember my math teacher's name, and I can't remember what I did to earn my punishment -- I think I was more disrespectful than usual, and I may have called her a name. Certainly not good behavior on my part. But I <em>do</em> remember being summoned to her room after school to take my whuppin'. It was a big wooden paddle, with holes drilled in it so it would hurt worse.</p><p></p><p>She got one lick in before I grabbed it away from her, threw it done, and walked out. I remember my absolute, implacable <em>rage</em>, clear as day. I was tired of people hitting me, and I didn't care if it was a teacher, or if it was condoned by the school, the Texas Board of Education, God and sonny Jesus. I was just <em>done</em>. If not with the beatings, if not with the petty cruelty and monstrous indifference of the universe I moved in, I was at least done with <em>accepting</em> it. I wasn't going to be a victim anymore. I was going to fight back.</p><p></p><p>There's a scene in the movie <em>Good Will Hunting</em> where Matt Damon talks about his father's abuse. \"He used to just put a belt, a stick, and a wrench on the kitchen table and say, 'Choose.'\"</p><p></p><p>\"Well, I gotta go with the belt there,\" says his therapist, Robin Williams, but Damon shakes his head. \"I used to go with the wrench.\"</p><p></p><p>\"Why?\" says Williams. \"Because fuck him, that's why,\" Damon replies.</p><p></p><p><em>That</em>. Precisely<em> that</em>.</p><p></p><p>And I never did <em>let</em> anybody hurt me again. Oh, I got my ass kicked from here to Christmas Island, and not just once. I lost a lot of fights -- literally and figuratively. But I didn't <em>let</em> it happen. I fought back. I gave as good as I could, and sometimes as good as I got.</p><p></p><p>Once, when I pissed off one of my mother's boyfriends, a big dumb fuck named Marty, he gave me two options: I could let him lock me in my bedroom for three days without food or water, or I could let him go after me with his horse whip. (He was a professional hunter's guide.) So I let him lock me in the bedroom...and then I kicked out the window and went to stay with friends until it blew over.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing noble in my anger. I was a nasty little shit, confused and enraged and smashing into the world like a wounded beast. I'm sure I made my family's life a living hell. But it was anger or oblivion. It was all I had.</p><p></p><p>And sometimes my anger failed on me; sometimes the sorrow would get the best of me, and that's when I'd go in my bedroom or go get drunk in an alley and cut myself with a knife or a broken bottle, or stand on the edge of a high building and think about what it would be like, the sudden leap in my stomach as I jumped, and those last few whirling seconds of misery before everything just went the fuck away. I think the first time I really, honestly contemplated suicide, I was probably twelve or so.</p><p></p><p>I never really seriously tried it, even the one time I cut my wrists in public like a massive asshole emo kid and got held on a 5150 in California. (They can hold you for 72 hours, but they kept me overnight; in the morning, the doctor on duty at the psych ward said \"Do you feel like an idiot?\" I said yes. \"Are you going to do this again?\" I said no. He let me walk. Hey, I was nineteen. There was a girl. Sigh.) But I seriously <em>considered</em> it a lot. Truth be told, I still do, sometimes. Sometimes depression grabs ahold of me and leaches all the color out of the world, and I tell myself that nothing matters, that I'm still a waste of potential, that I've never done anything important or valuable.</p><p></p><p>And the thing that keeps me from doing it, every time, is my absolutely refusal to give the sonsofbitches, whoever they may be, the satisfaction. Why not commit suicide? Because fuck him, that's why; fuck him and fuck you and fuck the uncaring, cruel universe.</p><p></p><p>I'm angry because the world is cold and unfair and<em> it doesn't have to be</em>, and I'm never going to get past that bedrock of betrayal, that original sin. I'm angry because I believe in a better world, and because I hate the things and the people who stand between me and that world. And because, as Johnny Lydon once said, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zN-GGeNPQEg\" target=\"_blank\">anger is an energy</a>. It's a sword and a shield that you can use to keep the black-eyed dog from sniffing at your door, a way to protect yourself and stand up for people who can't stand up for themselves. You don't cry; you snarl and sneer.</p><p></p><p>I'm not saying this is right, or the best way to face the world. But I'm old enough now to understand that there really <em>is</em> no right way to live; all that matters is you find a way to survive in the world. For some people, the world is a Burning Man camp where you embrace the change you want to see in the world; for others, the world is an alley fight and you get your back good and hard against a wall and you don't let the motherfuckers get you off your feet. The universe is big enough and weird enough that both of these things can be true simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>There's a line at the end of the movie <em>Se7en</em> that I have taken, this last year, as my credo; it is for me the equivalent of the motivational posters and inspirational quotes many people post on their Facebook walls and in their cubicles. At the end of <em>Se7en</em>, Morgan Freeman says, in a mournful voiceover: \"Ernest Hemingway once wrote: 'The world is a fine place, and worth fighting for.' I agree with the second part.\"</p><p></p><p><em>That.</em> Precisely <i>that</i>.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

                "content": "<p><em>This is the first draft of my introduction to my upcoming book, which is currently (tentatively) entitled </em>Digging For Fire: Seeking Innovation In East Africa. <em>This may not make it to the final book, or at least not exactly like this, but I thought I'd post it as a teaser.</em></p><p></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">There's a trunk, sitting in my living room.</span></p><p></p><p>It's not a wildly unique example of the form, as far as trunks go: a footlocker, neither particularly large, nor particularly small, made from sheet metal. The outside is painted an electric blue, with rudimentary abstract designs spray-painted on it with silver spray paint, like an aspiring teenage heavy metal guitarist might put on his pawn-shop axe. The inside is an especially offensive shade of shit brown. It's unremarkable, timeless -- if you saw it in the background of a black and white photograph from the late nineteeth century, it would not immediately leap out to the eye as an anachronism. It's the kind of trunk you might pick up at a discount hardware store to keep attic junk in, the kind of trunk that gets stamped out for pennies by the billions in Southeast Asian mass production factories and shipped to every corner of the earth.</p><p></p><p>But this particular trunk does not hail from Southeast Asia or, indeed, a mass production line anywhere. It is a <i>jua kali</i> trunk, and it began its existence in Gikomba, a massive, sprawling marketplace adjacent to the Industrial District of Nairobi, Kenya. It is, quite literally, artisanal, in the sense that it was made by an artisan, who assembled it by hand from recycled materials using handmade tools, sitting on the packed earth floor of his tin-roofed stall, with his shitty Tecno cell phone sitting on a hand-welded workbench, blasting Bob Marley or Kanye West.</p><p></p><p>I know this because I bought this trunk from such an artisan in Gikomba -- or rather, my taxi driver bought it, insisting that if I attempted to purchase it myself, as a stupid white man, the trunk's maker would hike the price up four or five times what he'd charge a local. (I got to wait in the taxi and scare off carjackers with my knife. Having experienced the fine Kenyan art of haggling, I'm pretty sure I got the less stressful side of the bargain.)</p><p></p><p><i>Jua kali</i> is Swahili for \"fierce sun\", and it refers to the 80% of Kenyans who make up the informal economy, outside the civil structures of taxation and regulation and paperwork: bored girls chilling out in rough wooden booths in the market, selling Safaricom mobile phone SIM cards and scratch-off airtime cards, old ladies selling bananas and mangos in roadside stalls, young hustlers with their stalls full of secondhand Lady Gaga and Seattle Seahawks t-shirts...and the makers, fixers, and jury-riggers sitting underneath that fierce sun in places like Gikomba, welding together wheelbarrows from bits of rebar and oil barrels and broken bicycles, or painstakingly repairing cheap Chinese mobile phones with homebrewed circuit testers. Their services are an absolute necessity in a place where simply popping into a big box retailer and purchasing what you need is impossible: where the average monthly wage can be as low as USD$60 and the nearest Home Depot is eight thousand miles away.</p><p></p><p>The <i>jua kali</i> world is what the futurist Alvin Toffler referred to as an \"adhocracy\", structureless and unregulated, a Darwinian ecology of problem-solving and gap-filling. In the informal economy, you don't have a <i>career</i>, per se; you may not even have a job title. You just find something that people will pay you to do, and do it as often and as long as you can, whether it's driving a taxi or selling peanuts in newspaper cones or making trunks and selling them to gigantic white weirdos. It's pure distilled personal entrepreneurship, in the absence of other viable options.</p><p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">* * *</p></p><p> My trunk is not a Ruskinite triumph of form and function, built to survive the millennium, exquisitely and lovingly hand-crafted by a master craftsman with a deep and spiritual connection to the <i>objets d'art</i> that issue from his hand. It is, in point of fact, kind of a piece of shit -- or, to put it more kindly, what the CEO of my last startup would've undoubtedly referred to as a \"minimum viable product\". The sheet metal from which it is made is only slightly thicker and sturdier than cardboard, the rivets have already begun to pop out, it reeks of cheap paint, and it barely survived the long journey from Nairobi back to Las Vegas, where I live.</p><p></p><p>But it <i>did</i> survive, and accomplished the task which I set for it, which was to get my clothes and souvenirs home without spilling them all over the tarmac of the Amsterdam airport. And that's the point. The <i>jua kali</i> is not about pursuing perfection or about ruthless efficiency. It's about getting shit done, however you can. It's the socioeconomic equivalent of duct tape and chewing gum, and it holds Kenya -- and, under other names, most of the developing world -- together.</p><p></p><p>These signal virtues of the <i>jua kali</i> -- finding gaps and filling them, working fast and cheap and under the radar, rapidly building the minimum viable product -- are also, at least on paper, the values that lie at the heart of the ascendant Western technology startup industry. So it is little surprise that Kenya -- and, to a lesser extent, neighboring Uganda -- are hot spots for East Africa's rising tech industry. As we'll see in this book, a combination of historical, cultural and economic factors put these countries in a unique position to become tech hubs for all of sub-Saharan Africa in the twenty-first century.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it's difficult to see the East African tech industry unfiltered by the unblinking lens of the fierce sun. A lot of the coders and designers and and entrepreneurs who inhabit incubators and hackerspaces like Nairobi's iHub and Kampala's Hive Colab got their start in the informal economy, and a lot of them still reside there in some way or another. And it is the <i>jua kali </i>mindset -- relentlessly seeking ways to survive, improve, produce -- that will drive their success.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">* * *</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>For many Western readers, it may come as a surprise that East Africa even <i>has</i> a technology industry, much less a growing and thriving one. Sub-Saharan Africa, we are told, is a savage landscape of warlords and genocide, starving children and rampant disease. For many Americans, their only association with Uganda is Joseph Kony, the lunatic leader of the Lord's Resistance Army who believes himself to be possessed by spirits and press-gangs children into his militia to commit baroque atrocities. Mention Kenya and you might get vague notions of elephants and lions, or the recent attack by militant Somali Muslims on the Westgate mall, or sad platitudes about Kibera, the largest slum in Africa. When I arrived in Nairobi, I was warned by several acquaintances on social networks to be very careful to watch out for hippos.</p><p></p><p>While none of these ideas are <i>wrong</i>, precisely, they paint a completely inaccurate picture of the realities of life in East Africa. Sitting on the porch of an apartment in Kampala, drinking Coke Zero and looking out at the shores of Lake Victoria, I was in no more danger from Kony's sad child soldiers than I would have been in my own bedroom; and Kibera, though achingly poor, is far from the abyss of endless sorrow and misery that is often suggested by humanitarian and relief groups and non-governmental organizations. (And while there are certainly hippos in Kenya, and though they can certainly present a lethal danger if provoked, Nairobi is a sprawling city of three million people; your chances of being killed by a rampaging hippo in its streets are roughly equivalent to your chances of being mauled by a goddamn grizzly bear while sipping a latté in Seattle's Pike Place Market.)</p><p></p><p>Our stories in the developed world about sub-Saharan Africa are sparse and sensationalistic, and tinged with the remnants of Victorian-era colonialism, misguided paternalism, and <i>sub rosa</i> racism. Consequently, we fill in the gaps with assumptions, many of which, even if well-meaning, are simply wrong. For example, when I sent out an email during my campaign to crowdfund my research trip for this book, an acquaintance who's a grad student in sociology replied, saying that my project seemed tinged with cultural imperialism -- as if I was imposing my Western obsessions with technology onto people who did not adhere to my cultural ideas. And while there are certainly big differences between Western and African social values, I'm pretty sure that the thirty million mobile phone subscribers in Kenya -- and the six hundred and fifty million mobile phone users in all of Africa -- would find that notion amusing.</p><p></p><p>As I walked the muddy streets of Nairobi and Kampala, as I sat and talked with nerds over full English breakfasts and excellent East African coffee and perused beautiful paintings in a shanty art gallery in Kibera, I realized that, as much as this book needed to be about technology, it also needed to be about <i>stories</i>: the West's stories and the stories Africa tells about itself, the ones we're told and the ones we never hear.</p><p></p><p>And so this is my story of my experience of the tech world in East Africa. I cannot claim that it is <i>the</i> truth; merely my truth, as I saw it. And I hope that it may, in some small way, help people understand that the reality is far more complex and fascinating than the simple portrait of sub-Saharan Africa often painted in Western media. Like my wonderful, shitty <i>jua kali</i> trunk, there is more here than meets the eye.</p><p></p><p>Joshua Ellis</p><p>Mobile, Alabama</p><p>December 26th, 2013</p>",

            "source": {
                "content": "<p><em>This is an email I just sent to myself, in case anyone is reading my accounts.</em><br /><br />Maybe you're not reading this. <br /><br />Maybe you're just collating it, my words encoded on a hard drive in some weird anonymous building out in the middle of Cheap Real Estate Land, where the only sound is the big trucks going by on the freeway outside. Or maybe, just maybe, there's something here that pulls a semantic trigger, some Markov chain of words that shunts my email down this chute instead of that one: this chute, with the red flag on it. Maybe you really are sitting at your desk in your cubicle in Fort Meade, reading these words. Deciding what to do about them.<br /><br />I warned people about you, you know. When the towers fell, all those years ago now, and everyone was talking about the realignment of the FBI and the CIA, the increased cooperation between the various intelligence agencies, I kept asking: what about the NSA? Nobody seemed to know. Nobody seemed to want to talk about it. Nobody, for a long time, would even admit you existed.<br /><br />But now we know what you were doing: you were building an archive of everything. I didn't think you could do it, frankly; didn't think even your massive budgets could handle storing every email, every direct message, every phone call. Even if you had the data, I thought, you couldn't ever sort through all of it in any useful way. More fool me.<br /><br />I don't like you. I don't mean that I don't like your employer, or I don't like your mission. Even though I don't know who you are, I don't like you, personally. Because you're not just in that chair, reading this email, because you needed a job. The NSA doesn't hire off Craigslist posts. You worked to get this job. This was a career plan for you, something that took you months or maybe even years to get to.<br /><br />That means you <em>wanted this job</em>. You wanted to be sitting there, reading this email. Maybe you do it out of a misguided sense of patriotism, a belief that you are making America safe from terrorists. If so, you're just a deluded fool. You know that, right? Even if you're protecting <em>something</em> from the threat of terror, it's not America, or at least any America that I recognize. And I am just as American as you are.<br /><br />But I think it more likely that you're simply the kind of person who loves having secrets -- your own and those of other people. It doesn't really matter what they are -- illicit affairs, drug use, murder, incest, maybe even every so often the actual mutterings of God-deluded jihadis. Information, you dig, is power...and if you have access to all the information, what does that make you, at least in your head?<br /><br />But you are not a god. You are a clerk, a wretched little civil servant with a gaping hole where your ethical center ought to be. You are the very embodiment of the assertion that a society that would trade liberty for security deserves neither. You, my friend, are a peeping Tom, a rat, a fink, a betrayer of the ideals upon which this country was founded. You are the one who does not mind their own business. You are a traitor, more so than your former colleague Edward Snowden will ever be.<br /><br />We are not afraid of terrorists, of sad little men sitting in yurts in a desert on the far side of the world, making ignorant plans that will never come to fruition. Some of these men might succeed in waging their war, to be sure...but not many, and not very often, and most of them are foiled by their own witlessness.<br /><br />99% of the rest of them can be stopped by good old fashioned law enforcement and the kind of intelligence work which all of us understand and most of us condone: the kind where you pick a target, rather than casting your net over all and sundry. <br /><br />That last 1%, the ones who can only be stopped by your warrantless, unwarranted surveillance of every American and every non-American whose flow of information you can get your hands on? I would rather they succeed in their murderous efforts than see you succeed in yours. Because all they can do is kill people, kill buildings; but you and yours are killing the last vestiges of what was great in America, great about America. Their dust will settle, but yours never will, until everything that we have worked for in this great experiment has swept away.<br /><br />And that is their true goal, and again, I call you a traitor, because <em>you are doing their work for them</em>. They don't want to kill Americans. They want to destroy America, and in that, you are their greatest collaborator.<br /><br />I urge you to do this: walk away. Walk away from that desk. You don't have to be Snowden, you don't have to blow any whistles or name any names or steal any files. You can mark your protest against the cheap schemes of your employers by simply refusing to do their bidding. Someone else may step up, someone else will step up...but that person won't be you. You can make your stand.<br /><br />If that's not something you can or will do -- if that's not something you feel is right -- if you think that reading this email of mine is the right thing to do, that invading the privacy of me and my fellow citizens without reason, without cause, without warrant, is a noble and just act -- then I would ask that you pick up a pen from your desk, walk down the hallway to the nearest restroom...and jam it as hard as you can into your own jugular, and bleed out there on the cheap tile floor. <br /><br />Because I do not like you, you see. And though I will never raise a hand against you or your employers, I wish you ill, and I would rather live in a world without people who believe that they deserve the power to pry into every human life, not because they can help, but because it gives them power.<br /><br />Do the right thing, one way or another. History will thank you, either way.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Joshua Zachariah Ellis</p>",

            "source": {
                "content": "<p><br /><br />My campaign is live! Wonderfully, we raised over $2500 in the first day -- a quarter of the way there! There's still a ways to go, though, and I'd love your help, either by kicking in some cash (and getting a copy of the book in return) or by sharing the love.<br /><br />Here are a couple of frequently asked questions about the project:<br /><br /><strong>Do you have an actual itinerary?</strong><br /><br />Aside from a general schedule for flights, not yet. I plan to spend two weeks in and around Lagos and two weeks in and around Nairobi. But that will probably also include short trips to nearby cities like Accra, Ghana, which is only about 350 miles from Lagos, and I've committed to making a trip to Kilimanjaro, which is 150 miles south of Nairobi.<br /><br />Once the trip is funded, I'll be nailing down more specific plans. I already have some contacts in each city I'm reaching out to, and I'll set up meetings with them.<br /><br />I don't have any idea what hotels I'll be staying in or anything like that. When I travel, I tend to find the least expensive places I can reasonably stay in. In this case, the only things I really need are a door that locks, a private restroom, and air conditioning (not out of luxury, but to keep out mosquitos that carry malaria).<br /><br />I also believe in serendipity -- often I find the most interesting things just wandering around or by chance encounters.<br /><br /><strong>Aren't you promoting what Evgeny Morozov calls \"<a href='http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2013/05/evgeny-morozov-technology'>solutionism</a>\" with this project? Are you saying that all Africans need is technology to prosper?</strong><br /><br />No, and no. I don't believe technology is a panacea for every problem, and certainly not for the problems Africa faces. My sense is that Africa's problems are fractally complex at every societal level, just like anywhere else -- economic, cultural, social, and of course a big heaping dose of post-colonialist nightmares.<br /><br />That said, I think some of the serious problems facing sub-Saharan Africa <i>are</i> problems that can be solved -- or at least alleviated -- with technological and engineering solutions. I'm just not sure which ones, which is why I'm making the trip.<br /><br />More to the point, though, I'm not necessarily looking for \"answers\" to big, intractable problems. I'm just really interested in what people are making there, from a nerd's perspective. Hopefully I'll be able to maybe put some of the pieces together as I go.<br /><br /><strong>Where did you come up with the $10000 figure? Do you have a budget?</strong><br /><br />Yep! I have a rough budget based on Internet research -- checking travel advice sites and such. It looks something like this:<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>Airfare: $2500 (including taxes, airport fees, etc)</li><br /><li>Hotels: $50/night x 30 = $1500</li><br /><li>Food: $30/day x 30 = $900</li><br /><li>Vaccinations: $1000</li><br /><li>Transportation (buses between cities, taxis, etc.) $1000</li><br /></ul><br /><br />Those are estimates, rounded up for safety's sake, but that brings us to right around $7000. The other $3K is for anything else -- bribes, unforeseen stuff -- and to pay my bills at home while I'm gone.<br /><br />$10K sounds like a lot, but for a month overseas it's actually kind of low. And if anything serious happens -- like I get hurt or really sick -- I might be in trouble. But, hey, <em>c'est la vie</em>.<br /><br /><strong>So what happens when you get back?</strong><br /><br />I put the book together. I'll be writing it as I go along -- both taking notes and also writing actual prose. I'll be sending it as I write it to an editor back here in the States, just in case anything happens to me -- I want to make sure that, no matter what, my backers get a finished product, even if something goes pear-shaped. When I get back to Vegas, I'll be working with my editor to assemble the final book, as well as designing the deluxe edition -- in addition to being a writer, I'm a pretty decent graphic designer as well. When it's done -- I'm estimating the end of January, 2014 -- I'll be sending it out.<br /><br /><strong>Will there be a print version?</strong><br /><br />There will definitely be a print version for backers who selected one as their perk -- it'll be printed on demand for them. Will there be a mass market edition? That remains to be seen. I'd love to get a publisher who'd like to make that happen.<br /><br /><strong>Isn't this a bit dangerous? Aren't you worried about it?</strong><br /><br />That's a complicated question. The answer is: no, I'm not, but not because I don't think there's an element of danger. My experience traveling is that most places that aren't active war zones are pretty much like any other places: as long as you don't act like an asshole, you're usually fine. That was my experience in Juarez, and I suspect it'll hold true in Lagos and Nairobi as well.<br /><br />But there <i>are</i> risks, and I'd be an idiot if I wasn't aware of them. There are anti-American Islamic groups in both cities. Both cities have terrible poverty, and the street crime that inevitably follows. Also, I'm a 6'3\" burly white man. I don't blend well in Africa.<br /><br />There's also the fact that I'm trying to put together one side trip that, if I can arrange it, will be ludicrously dangerous, which is why I'm not divulging it publicly yet -- I don't want to broadcast what I'm doing.<br /><br />The thing is: I don't really much care about my personal safety, to be honest. I'm more interested in telling the story I want to tell. I'm not reckless, but I'm not overly cautious, either, and if shit goes down, shit goes down. That's why I'll be transmitting my writing and notes daily.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong: I'm not looking for trouble. I'd like to avoid it if I can. But I need to be exposed to do this the way I want to do it, which is why I won't have a driver, a guide or security of any kind (other than myself).<br /><br /><strong>Will you bring me something back from Africa?</strong><br /><br />Not to be a jerk, but: probably not. Remember, I'm going to be moving around a lot, and carrying at least two bags (one for clothes, one for gear). I'll probably take another small bag folded up in my clothes bag for souvenirs, but I can't promise anybody anything. <br /><br />I could probably bring you back malaria, though, if you asked nicely.</p>",

And like most Americans, I've come to a series of conclusions and convictions about the gun control debate; a position I find morally and ethically solid.</p><p></p><p>And I'll tell you about it. But first I want to tell you about my own personal culture of violence. Maybe just to get it off my chest, but maybe also to explain why I feel the way I do.</p><p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">----------</p></p><p>The first time anybody pointed a gun at me, I was fourteen or fifteen, I guess. I lived with my mom and my stepdad in a trailer park a few miles outside of Hamilton, Montana. We were poor, then: poor enough we didn't have a telephone, poor enough that our primary source of heat was a pot-bellied wood stove that sat on a porcelain riser in the middle of our trailer's living room, for which I split endless cords of wood in the side yard with a hand-held hatchet. It was grueling, tiring work, and I avoided it when I could.</p><p></p><p>Mom and Dad were out that night, though I can't remember where or why. What I do remember is the sharp, rattling banging on the door of our trailer -- a door made of thin, crenellated sheet metal with cardboard inside.</p><p></p><p>I peeked through the narrow window of the door and saw, outside, a group of boys. I knew them all, knew they hated me in the way that small-town bullying assholes hate anybody weird or different. A couple of them hated my mother and I, because of a dispute with <em>their</em> mother.</p><p></p><p>There were, I think, four of them. Maybe five. And two of them held guns. I didn't know anything about guns, but these were semi-automatic handguns, not revolvers. They were grinning at me like feral dogs.</p><p></p><p>One of them held his pistol up. \"Come out, faggot,\" he said. \"Come out, bitch.\" The others took up the chant -- <em>come out, motherfucker, come out, faggot</em> -- as they waited, patiently, for me to open the door.</p><p></p><p>I remember the fear so clearly: that hideous <em>rising</em> sensation in your upper chest and your throat, like somebody blew up a helium balloon inside you that's trying to take off. I had no idea what to do. My parents were gone, we didn't have a phone. I couldn't call the cops, and even if I could, they were miles away, in town. Screaming wouldn't help -- in that trailer park, screams weren't especially unusual. I was at a loss.</p><p></p><p>To this day, I still don't know why I walked across the tiny living room of the trailer and picked up the wood-chopping hatchet. I took it back to the window, showed it to the boys through that thin strip of safety glass...and slammed it, as hard as I could, into the door, as if I was going to hack through it and go after <em>them</em>. I think I was screaming, at the top of my lungs. I remember baring my teeth at them, through the door, and if anybody was feral that night it might have been me.</p><p></p><p>\"Alright,\" I said. \"Here I come.\"</p><p></p><p>They looked confused, uneasy. Then they began to back away. They jumped in their car and drove away. I was left still standing behind the door, which now bore a bright shiny wound in its ugly brown facade. That's how I know they use cardboard to fill out trailer doors, you see.</p><p></p><p>I caught hell when my parents came home. I couldn't seem to make them understand my fear. All they knew was that I'd trashed the house. I don't know if they believed my story or not.</p><p></p><p>Nor do I know, even now, if the guns those boys had were \"real\" guns or pellet guns...or if they actually would've shot or killed me. Maybe they just wanted to scare me. Maybe they would've stood around me in a circle and beaten me, as they did before and after that night, or just pistol-whipped me. I don't know. But I do know that was the night I learned a secret that kept me alive and free of permanent physical (if not emotional or psychological) damage throughout my turbulent, violent adolescence.</p><p></p><p>If you can't talk or fight your way out of a situation, go crazy. It'll usually scare 'em so bad they run away.</p><p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">----------</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Based on their rhetoric, I suspect that most gun advocates have the same fantasy running through their heads when they start talking about why they need a gun for home defense. It's the one where they awake in the middle of the night from a deep slumber at a gentle, unexplained noise from downstairs -- a door whispering open, perhaps, or a window sliding up.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">They reach into their bedside drawer and pull out their Glock or Colt or whatever their weapon of choice is. They slide out of bed, Honey Bunny still blissfully unaware and sleeping by their side, and through the bedroom door and silently down the stairs, like Jason Bourne, until they reach the ground floor. They peer cautiously around the corner. There's the perp, his hands deep into the wife's jewelry case.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Hands up</em>, they cry, <em>or I'll shoot!</em></p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And here's where I think the public version and the private version of that fantasy -- the version they'll admit to, and the <em>real</em> one inside their head -- diverge. In the public version, the perp puts his hands up, and Honey Bunny calls the cops while our suburban Jason Bourne keeps his piece carefully aimed at the center of the perp's mass, and the day is saved by a careful and conscientious gun owner. And, of course, the Second Amendment, God bless it and keep it.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But I believe that, for many of these people, the private fantasy ends differently. It ends with the perp whirling, his own (illegally-obtained) gun in his hand, ready to kill. He's fast...but our Constitution defender is faster, and before you can say \"cold dead hands\", the perp's brain is spattered all over the Thomas Kinkaide painting Honey Bunny got for Christmas two years ago. Another evildoer sent to Hell. No great loss.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">I think that's the <em>real</em> fantasy...because I've had it myself, a time or two. I'm pretty sure it's damn common, this blood-spattered Walter Mitty alpha male daydream of the righteous kill. It's kissing cousins with those other popular current reveries: If I'd Been In That Theater, I Woulda Put That Sonofabitch Down and, of course, If Those Teachers Had Had Guns, No Children Woulda Died In Connecticut That Day.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">These phantasmagories are, perhaps, the <em>real</em> American Dream.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And dreams are all they are, of course. If you want a <em>nightmare </em>instead, you might try imagining a Colorado theater full of confused, angry people, bombarded by the sound and light show of a Batman movie cranked to full sensory disrupt hanging over them like an Old Testament spectacle, not to mention the screams and panicky jittering of all those folks around them, pulling their trusty handguns and attempting to make the righteous kill, to hit that <em>one</em> \"perp\"...who, of course, is only one of many people with guns in their hands. In the flashing, strobing darkness.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Christ, they'd <em>still</em> be hosing the ticketholders off the walls.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And that's still not as bad as the nightmares that plague the sleep of those unfortunate, stupid souls who head downstairs in the small hours of the morning, ready to heroically defend their castle against the junkie or rapist who's intruded into the sanctity of their home...only to find themselves staring at the son or daughter who decided that was the night to sneak out to go smoke cigarettes and drink cheap beer with their friends, lying on the linoleum, making a noise like a hooked fish as their lungs fill up with blood, thanks to the .357 round that's suddenly turned their chest cavity into an object lesson in fluid dynamics and entropy. In those nightmares, our Jason Bourne is kneeling next to their dying child, shouting <em>Baby? Oh my God baby I'm so sorry somebody call 911!</em>as their offspring bleeds out and becomes nothing more than a carefully-dusted photograph on the mantelpiece.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Over and over again. Forever.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">----------</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">I know about fear. I know about the terror of the sound in the night, the monster in human form showing up at your door with a weapon of personal destruction. I'm almost thirty-five years old and I still automatically look for the nearest exit in any room I enter. I still walk down the street with a mental model in my head of every pedestrian who is nearby, where the dark corners are that an attacker might spring from. When I hear a car engine suddenly rev up nearby, I automatically tense up, just in case it's the same sonsofbitches who roared past me in their big fruity Chevy pickup that soft spring night when I was sixteen and pegged me in the back of the head with an unopened can of Rolling Rock, knocking me semi-unconscious into a ditch, where I lay until I came to my senses.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And I understand rage. I understand righteous indignation, wanting to bring the holy fire down on the heads of the cruel and the evil and the stupid. I understand the unspoken hope that some stupid bastard is dumb enough to <em>actually break into your house</em>...because then, as Rorschach says in <em>Watchmen</em>, you're not trapped in there with them; now, they're trapped in there with <em>you</em>. I understand wanting a reason to hurt the ones you're afraid of.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">----------</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">One day, this kid Nick tells me he and his friends are going to beat the shit out of me before school the next morning. I don't mean the kind of ass-beating you see in movies about how high school sucks: I'm talking about an <em>American History X</em>-style stomping, the kind where somebody can end up in the hospital, or dead. (The kind that a similar set of ignorant trash gave my acquaintance Matthew Shepherd a couple of years after he got out of high school, in fact.) I had no reason to doubt him. He wasn't the first to make such a threat, or carry it out. I had my nose broken for the first time a few months before those boys showed up at my door; a few months later, another similar set of boys kicked me until they broke a rib.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">So I went home that night, and I looked through my library, this being before Internet access was especially common, until I found a book that gave a description of how to make napalm out of Ivory soap and gasoline. I decided this was my only answer. My parents didn't seem to much give a shit, and most of the authority figures in my life seemed to despise me as much as the other kids did. So I was going to light this motherfucker Nick up like the goddamn Tet Offensive.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Thank God I didn't have access to a double boiler, or gasoline, for that matter. Instead, I mixed a bunch of isopropyl alcohol into liquid dish soap, poured it into a Tupperware container, and shoved it in my backpack. I couldn't find a lid for the Tupperware, so I wrapped it in Saran Wrap.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The next morning, I got to school a half-hour early with my package of death, and decided to pour a little of it on the sidewalk and test it -- kind of a trial run. And of course, it did nothing at all -- the alcohol had either evaporated out of the container, or my mixture was wrong. Not that it would've done much in either case anyway.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">My one moment of Columbine-style mayhem was over before it began. Instead, when Nick showed up, he called me a faggot and punched me hard in the face once, and I fell over and cried like a sissy, and everybody laughed, and he went on his way, his adolescent ego maintained and my own kicked down another flight of stairs.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">It terrifies me, in retrospect, to think what would've happened if I hadn't been such a retard -- if I'd melted Nick's face off his skull. He was a brutish, vicious little asshole, but he didn't deserve that. Nothing righteous about that little bit of wetwork.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But it doesn't terrify me nearly as much as the thought of what would've happened if my dad had owned a gun.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Two of my friends, those first couple of years of high school, got their hands on a gun. Both of them used those guns on themselves, though from all accounts they might've done better to start with other members of their households. But they didn't. Both of them went out into the Montana wilderness and put those guns in their mouths, and ended everything they might ever have been. The second one, my friend Sarah, went into the woods in November; they didn't find her until the snow began to thaw in February, and by then there wasn't enough left to fill a bucket. Her casket was closed at the funeral.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And I might've joined them, in my misery and terror, if there hadn't always been a little titanium core of self-preservation at the center of my wobbling teenage self. Or I might've showed up in my high school one day with the intention of, as Stephen King once put it, \"getting it on\".</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">When Columbine happened I was twenty-one years old, still young enough that those wounds were still bleeding...and my first thought, when I heard what Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold did, was empathy; not with the murdered, but the murderers. I knew -- or thought I knew -- how it came to that, how the hurt and the hate builds up. I remember that high school feels like a life stretch in a big house where the guards don't pay attention and the other prisoners all want to fuck you up until you go crazy. I got it.<em></p><p></em></p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">I was wrong, of course. Klebold and Harris weren't purveyors of the righteous kill, either, any more than I would've been with my little Fauxlatov cocktail. They were victims, but as the main character in my favorite high school movie said:<em> aren't we all?</em> They were just animals, as dumb and mean as the animals who wounded them. Animals, the way James Holmes is and Adam Lanza was an animal.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But unlike real animals, they had their guns. Lots and lots of guns.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">----------</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">America <em>does</em> have a culture of violence, make no mistake about it. But that culture is not embodied in violent video games and movies and comic books, or any of the other culprits that gun advocates like to trot out whenever some waterhead goes over the high side and starts mass murdering people.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The violence in America is embedded at the very heart of our culture, in those core values that nationalistic jerkoffs love to trot out at every opportunity: our rugged individualism, our can-do spirit, our supposed toughness. (I say \"supposed\" because it's hard to regard people as tough when they're so terrified of every shadow that they feel the need to carry military-grade munitions to protect themselves. That, speaking for myself, is the definition of craven and chickenshit. But I digress.) America's motto might as well be <em>Fuck You, I Got Mine</em>. America isn't about intellectual freedom, it's about property rights and the ability to defend the same from anyone who encroaches upon them. What's mine is mine, and if you try to take it, I'll kill you: <em>that</em>'s the American way.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">That's where our love of guns comes from. Guns are a marvelous tool for defending our property from those who might like to take or damage it. It's hard to imagine that conservative Second Amendment advocates really give much of a shit about totalitarian encroachment upon freedom; after all, they're the ones who cheer the War on Drugs and the War on Terror, who have nothing to say as our lawmakers sidestep not only the letter but the spirit of the Constitution and allow indefinite detainment without trial and assassination of American citizens. Their fear is not about the erosion of basic human freedom; they don't care about free speech, due process. They care about anything that threatens their right to own the things they own and to keep them, without question. That's why those self-same defenders of the Constitution mostly stood by idly while George W. Bush used 9/11 as an excuse to wipe his ass with that sainted document...but squawk like ugly, hysterical hens when Barack Obama tries to figure out ways to ensure that all Americans have access to basic healthcare. Because that's taking money out of <em>their</em> pockets, and putting it into the pockets of all those freeloading immigrants, yadda yadda yadda. And money trumps freedom, every time.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The problem is not that Americans have guns. The problem is that Americans, by and large, cannot be <em>trusted</em> with guns: not to carry, and maybe not to own.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">There's another fantasy that the NRA and their groupies like to trot out: the Law-Abiding Gun Owner. These people are the last line of defense against the Bad Guys, in this line of thinking -- a different breed, one feels. But that's bullshit. James Holmes was a law-abiding gun owner right up until he walked into that theater in Colorado. Adam Lanza's mom was a law-abiding gun owner, but that didn't stop her psychotic son from taking her guns, killing her with them, and then playing <em>Call Of Duty</em> in the local elementary school. Everyone's a Law-Abiding Gun Owner, right until they become a Bad Guy. And it's nearly impossible to tell who's going to take off their white hat and put on the black one, or when. In the wake of Aurora and Sandy Hook, a lot of people called for better mental health access in America; and while that's fine, and I agree with them, the reality is that people like Holmes and Lanza don't go looking for help very often, because as far as they're concerned, they don't <em>need</em> help. They're the heroes in their own stories; it's everyone <em>else</em> that's insane and malign. It's everyone else who needs to be dealt with.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>But those are crazy people</em>, goes the response. <em>Evil people. Not good people</em>. Maybe, but you know what? Difficult as it might be to institute a moratorium on the public and private sale of assault weapons, it's still a helluva lot easier to implement than a moratorium on crazy, or evil, or just being a stupid thoughtless tiny-dicked jerk-off who carries a piece because it makes you feel like more of a man.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">You can't ban crazy. But you can make it harder for crazy to go crazy in such a very wholesale way.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Also, let's clear something up right now: the Constitution of the United States does not confer upon you, the American citizen, the right to own a semi-automatic weapon. It says this, and <em>only this</em>:</p></p><p></p><p><blockquote></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.</p></p><p></blockquote></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> If you define \"arm\" as a synonym for \"weapon\" with no qualification, well, homie, sorry to disappoint you, but that particular right was infringed upon a long goddamn time ago. If you don't believe me, walk down Main Street of your town with a broadsword strapped to your back. Unlike a pistol, you can't get a permit to carry a sword, concealed or otherwise. (This despite a fairly conspicuous lack of mass decapitations, or innocent children getting killed accidentally during a slash-by.) Your right to keep and bear that particular sort of arm was infringed upon, in most American jurisdictions, in the nineteenth century.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">On the other end of the spectrum, there's nuclear bombs. A nuclear bomb is an \"arm\", by anyone's definition, and frankly, if your concern is a sinister (i.e. liberal) government instituting a totalitarian overthrow of the country, I'm pretty sure a nuke is a better deterrent against the unholy might of the United States military than your trusty Colt .45. But even the most rabid NRA activist wouldn't argue that you ought to be able to own a nuke, or mount an antitank missile launcher on the roof of your pickup truck. Hell, very few people would say that it's reasonable for you to be able to carry a grenade launcher or a Vulcan minigun...and yet these are, by definition, \"arms\".</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">So we all agree there are some weapons that nobody needs to have. Why not put assault weapons in that category? They're useless for home defense, unless you're getting home invaded by the fucking Predator. Ditto game hunting, unless you just really want to skip the whole pesky step of turning your elk meat into jerky. It's really fun to go and shoot them at a range, but so what? It's fun to go fishing with dynamite, too. The fun factor is outweighed by the risk to society at large.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And I'm going to say this right now: if you can't adequately defend your home with a shotgun or a low-capacity handgun, if you seriously believe need an AK-47 with a 30-round clip, you're a stupid, dangerous asshole, period, and I'll be happy to tell you that to your face. I hope you don't have kids, partially because they'll be in your line of fire, and partially because I simply hope you're not in the breeding pool. Let's leave the continuation of our species to people worthy of that task, okay?</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Me? I keep a machete leaning against the wall next to my bed, as my absolute <em>last</em> line of home defense. My <em>first</em> line, mind you, is the set of bars on my windows and doors, which are far more effective than any gun could ever be. My second line of defense is that 'Emergency Call' button on my cell phone.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">As much as I enjoy my own little preemptory revenge fantasies where I'm Liam Neeson in <em>Taken</em>, with that much-vaunted \"particular set of skills\", the reality is that I don't actually want to kill <em>anybody</em>, not even some idiot who's desperate enough to try and break into my house to take what I have.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">----------</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">I'll tell you one more story, before I'm done.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Back in Hamilton, back in the day, there used to be a little rec center, in a big cavernous building that used to be a supermarket. I have no idea if it's still there or not; I've never returned to that place since I left, and I'm grateful for that fact. But when I was in high school it was there, and we used to go down there and dance to the grunge music that was popular in those dim dead days, and stand outside smoking and drinking filched booze mixed heavily with soda and trying to look cool.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">One night, in some fit of melodramatic teenage angst, I wandered away from the rec center and out past the lights of the parking lot, into the empty field next door. There was probably a girl, or the lack of one, involved. You know how it is.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">I was too busy brooding to pay attention, until I heard the rustling of feet in the grass. I looked up and saw them: another group of boys (and one big hulking slab of a girl, not coincidentally the sister of one of the boys who'd shown up at my door that night with guns). They'd seen me drifting away; they followed me.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The leader was this kid named Sam, as I remember. He wasn't big, but he was mean and stupid, in that sort of snarling juvenile delinquent kind of way. At the end of that school year, when he was seventeen or eighteen, he dropped out to go drive big rigs with his old man, full-time, and I never saw him again. But he was there that night, grinning at me. I don't remember exactly why he hated me. Did I smart off to him? Make him feel stupid, as payback for him making me feel terrified?</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Does it even matter?</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">They surrounded me. There was the usual talk. <em>Hey, faggot. You think you're funny now, faggot, you fuckin queer cocksucking fucking bitch?</em> For a man who's never touched another man's penis in my life, I've gotten gay-bashed more times than I'd care to count. I don't know if they actually thought I was gay, but again: does it even matter?</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Then they started spitting. All of them. Big, gooey loogies, on my face, my neck, the back of my head, my clothes. Laughing as they did. All of them but Sam. He just stood there, two feet away from me, grinning his sick grin.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Whatcha gonna do, faggot? You wanna go? Come on, faggot.</em></p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And I had a moment of absolute clarity. Everything went cold and clear. This was years before <em>The Matrix</em>, but my world went into bullet time.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">I saw that I could reach up, grab Sam by either side of his head, and break his neck. I could do it before he could react, before any of them could react. I knew I had the physical strength to do it: I had already nearly reached my full height of six foot three then, and I could pick up a washing machine from a dead lift and put it on the back of a pickup truck. I was bullied not because I was weak, but because I was slow, and couldn't really fight very well.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But I didn't need to fight Sam. I could just put my hands out and kill him, in an instant.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">I could feel my hands twitching, eager to end all of this in that one instant.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">You probably think I was wrong, or that I was fantasizing. But I've thought about this a lot over the last twenty years, and I remain as convinced now as I was that night that I was absolutely correct in my assessment of the situation. At that moment, though I was the one surrounded by jeering enemies, their phlegm dripping off my nose, I owned Sam's life. It was mine to end, if I wanted.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">My hands went up...and then down again. I didn't kill Sam. I just stood there, trembling with fury and fear and misery, my tears mingling with the spit on my face. I don't remember how it ended. I think maybe one of my friends happened to see what was happening and came up, shouting at them to leave me alone. Maybe Sam belted me one, or knocked me down, or just called me a faggot again and walked away. I have no memory of that.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Just Sam's face. Just his grin in the dark of that field, and the knowledge that I had the power of life and death in my crude boy's hands.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">----------</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">\"It's a helluva thing, killin' a man,\" says Clint Eastwood in the sublime Western film <em>Unforgiven</em>. \"Take away all he's got, and all he's ever gonna have.\" I don't think most Americans really understand that. We don't understand that there's no such thing as a righteous kill, not really: just murder, and you're on one side of it or the other. We love our guns because we don't really understand what they do. They don't solve the problem. They just make new ones.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Did Nick, he of the napalm science experiment, deserve to die? Did Sam? Of course not. They were vicious boys, and I still cannot bring myself to forgive them or wish them well, though I am satisfied with the knowledge that both of them probably ended up with precisely the sort of lives they deserved. But they didn't deserve death.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Nor did I deserve to kill them. Even if I'd been justified in doing it, even if I'd somehow managed to avoid prison or long-term confinement in a mental hospital, I still would have had to live with the ache and knowledge of what I'd done for the rest of my life. The fear and the horror they and all the others like them inflicted upon me, for all the years I was forcibly detained in the Guantanamo Bay we laughingly refer to as the American educational system, is nothing compared to that.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">At the heart of America's rage is fear, as it was at the heart of mine. We have our guns because we're afraid of being hurt, of losing what we have -- our lives, our loved ones, the things we've accumulated that form the mosaic of our lives. And like all frightened things, we act savagely. Back a dog into a corner and see what he does in his fear. We do no different.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And that's why I don't think we can be fully trusted with guns, ever; why other countries have as many guns but less deaths, less mayhem. The worst of us are the ones who want to share their pain and rage and confusion with others, the Eric Harrises and Dylan Klebolds and Adam Lanzas and James Holmeses. But even the best of us are dangerous in their terror.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">There's an old saying: <em>no man who actually wants to be President is suitable for the job</em>. Likewise,  I don't think that anybody who really <em>wants</em> a gun should be entrusted with one. I know this might offend my friends and acquaintances who are gun advocates, but I don't trust <em>anybody</em> with a gun. Because I don't trust that <em>any</em> individual has the skill and the wisdom to decide who deserves to live or die, and to carry out that decision.

            "name": "A real-world example of BAP robot architecture",
            "source": {
                "content": "<p>You'll have to excuse me -- I've got the flu today, and I might not be entirely coherent. But here's a concrete example of my BAP robotic framework. This is a simple robot with two motors (one on each side) and a GPS unit.</p><p></p><p><img  src=\"http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/robot-layout-1024x624.png\" /></p><p></p><p>The first thing we notice is that each of the motors is controlled by an H-bridge, which consists of four switches that allow current to flow in either direction through the motor itself -- or through a relay switch which turns on the motor, if the motor is high-voltage. (For our purposes, we'll assume it is, as a 5V robot is small and boring).</p><p></p><p>The H-bridge controls the relay, which controls current coming from a power supply to the motor. So with our system, we can turn each motor forward or backward. We can't control speed -- the motor is either on or off -- but that might be enough for our purposes.</p><p></p><p>We're using OSC, so let's call our robot <code>robot1</code>. The robot has two top-level endpoints, <code>sensors</code> and <code>motors</code>. These are arbitrarily named, and in point of fact we don't even need them -- we can assign top-level endpoints to every component in the robot. But let's leave it like this, as it's nice and tidy.</p><p></p><p>We see that the <code>motors</code> endpoint has two sub-endpoints, <code>leftMotor</code> and <code>rightMotor</code>. Our behavior system sends commands to these motors by issuing methods to the endpoint, like so:</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><ul></p><p><li><code><code>robot1/motors/leftMotor/goForward</code></code></li></p><p><li><code><code>robot1/motors/leftMotor/goBackward</code></code></li></p><p><li><code><code>robot1/motors/leftMotor/stop</code></code></li></p><p></ul></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>These three commands are all we can really do with these motors...but as we'll see, they can be used to instantiate a pretty sophisticated set of behaviors.</p><p></p><p>Our autonomic layer \"knows\" what these commands mean and how to actually make them happen. For example, pseudocode for our <code>goForward</code> function might look like this:</p><p><pre>function goForward(){</p><p>setSwitch(0).HIGH;</p><p>setSwitch(1).HIGH;</p><p>setSwitch(2).LOW;</p><p>setSwitch(3).LOW;</p><p>}</pre></p><p>The <code>setSwitch</code> commands simply turn the switches on the H-bridge connected to the relay connected to leftMotor to send current in a direction that rotates the motor counterclockwise (which, since it's on the left side, turns it \"forward\"). The <code>goBackward</code> function might turn switchs 2 and 3 to high and switches 0 and 1 to low; and the <code>stop</code> command might simply set all of them to low, or disconnect them. (We can get more funky by having the <code>stop</code> command reverse polarity for 10 milliseconds before disconnecting, which would work like an engine brake.)</p><p></p><p>Now, we've also got a sensor: namely the GPS unit on top of the robot. This provides two endpoints in our current scheme, <code>lat</code> and <code>lng</code>, though it could also provide a single endpoint which when queried returns a formatted string from the GPS like \"-37.3457532,30.12930495\" that our behavioral layer can decipher.</p><p></p><p>We'd query it by issuing a command like this (again, this is pseudocode):</p><p></p><p><code>var robotLat = osc.retrieve(/robot1/sensors/gps/lat);</p><p>var robotLng = osc.retrieve(/robot1/sensors/gps/lng);</code></p><p></p><p>Pretty straightforward, right? This way, our software can figure out where the robot is at any given time.</p><p></p><p>Now, you're maybe asking yourself: how does our software <em>connect</em> to the robot? How does the GPS data get translated and piped out to our endpoints? For that matter, how are our motors connected to the power supply? Does our control circuitry hook into the same power supply?</p><p></p><p>The answer is simple: <em>who gives a shit</em>? Really? The whole point of this is abstraction. The hardware engineer sorts out the physical layer, the firmware geek sorts out the autonomic layer, the programmer works out the behavioral level. None of them give a shit about any of the other layers, except insofar as their bit needs to hook into the other guy's bit.</p><p></p><p>The autonomic engineer spends months designing a really efficient cellular modem that receives commands from the Internet and turns them into hardware-specific commands. The design is brilliant. Other engineers buy him endless rounds at conventions for being a badass.</p><p></p><p>And the programmer neither knows nor cares about any of this, because all that matters is that the system responds to commands. Period.</p><p></p><p>Look, do you know anything about Javascript? Javascript lets you make web pages interactive. (Yes, it can do much more, blah blah Node.js blah blah blah. &lt;i&gt;Shut up.&lt;/i&gt; Pay attention.) One of the things you can interact with using Javascript is the mouse -- you can get the mouse's X and Y position relative to the screen or even the DOM object you're attaching the code to.</p><p></p><p>Doing this requires the browser to be able to retrieve relatively low-level data about the mouse's current status. In return, it does this by accessing the operating system's mouse driver, which uses a standard set of protocols to interface with the mouse's hardware, which might be optical or mechanical or a touchpad or motion sensors in the air.</p><p></p><p>But as far as the Web developer is concerned, who gives a shit how all of that works? So long as <code>window.mouseX</code> and <code>window.mouseY</code> are accurate, the rest of the process of turning physical movements into Cartesian coordinates is pretty much irrelevant.</p><p></p><p>Same thing here. There might be a more efficient way of controlling the motor than with an H-bridge and a relay switch, but as long as the motor can take in our three commands and turn them into motion, who gives a shit?</p><p></p><p>We have everything we need now to begin building complex logic into our robot. Let's use an example of a behavior I mentioned in a previous post: let's make our robot come and find us.</p><p></p><p>We have a GPS, so the robot knows where it is; and we have motors. What we <em>don't</em> have is a digital compass to help our robot orient itself...but we can still pull this off, with some code like so (again, this is pseudocode):</p><p><pre>var myLat = 36.1515;</p><p>var myLng = -115.2048;</p><p></p><p>var robotLat = osc.retrieve(robot1/sensors/gps/lat);</p><p>var robotLng = osc.retrieve(robot1/sensors/gps/lng);</p><p></p><p>if(robotLat != myLat &amp;&amp; robotLng != myLng){</p><p></p><p>oldLat = robotLat;</p><p>oldLng = robotLng;</p><p></p><p>osc.transmit(/robot1/motors/leftMotor/goForward);</p><p>osc.transmit(/robot1/motors/rightMotor/goForward);</p><p>wait(10000); // this is milliseconds</p><p></p><p>robotLat = osc.retrieve(robot1/sensors/gps/lat);</p><p>robotLng = osc.retrieve(robot1/sensors/gps/lng);</p><p></p><p>if(difference(robotLat, myLng) &gt; difference(oldLng)){</p><p>osc.transmit(/robot1/motors/leftMotor/stop);</p><p>osc.transmit(/robot1/motors/rightMotor/stop);</p><p>osc.transmit(/robot1/motors/leftMotor/goBackwards);</p><p>osc.transmit(/robot1/motors/rightMotor/goBackwards);</p><p>}</p><p></p><p>// and so on</p><p></p><p>}</pre></p><p>What this code does is make the robot \"try\" different directions by moving in a direction for ten seconds and seeing if that decreases the distance between its location and my location. Once it finds a direction that does so, it goes in that direction until its coordinates match my coordinates.</p><p></p><p>What if we want to make it more complex, \"smarter\"? We can add in a digital compass, which returns either a value in degrees (0-360) or as a mapped range (0-1, where 1 can be mapped to 360 degrees). Then our robot knows where it is and where it's pointed. It doesn't need to orient itself before it starts to move.</p><p></p><p>Our behavioral software can connect to Google Maps and get a series of directions, following roads, between the robot and us. We can then direct the robot using these directions, simply by issuing commands to our two motors. It doesn't matter that our robot doesn't know anything about Maps, or that Maps doesn't have robot navigation built in. Our behavioral layer handles that for us.</p><p></p><p>Is this complex? Sure it is. So it's a good thing we're not trying to do this with instructions hardwired into our robot. All the complexity of translating road directions into commands to turn motors for certain time periods, in certain directions, is offloaded to our behavioral layer, which can be on-board the robot or -- more likely -- connected over a network.</p><p></p><p>Of course, our robot still has to avoid cars as it trundles along public roads, and maybe it has to worry about recharging itself. But all we have to do is add more sensors -- touch sensors, range sensors, a battery level sensor. We can download the low-level stuff directly to the robot so there's no network latency between a command being issued and being carried out. For example, we can tell the robot \"if something triggers your range sensor, move away from it until it's not there anymore, then recalculate your travel direction\". Or \"if your battery gets below 25%, here's the GPS coordinates of a filling station where a nice person can charge you again. Go there instead of your initial location.\" Once the battery level is 100%, we simply resume our initial set of commands to reduce distance between the robot and us.</p><p></p><p>Simple, right? Well, not <em>simple</em>, not trivial, but not so complex we can't make it happen.</p><p></p><p>And here's the great part: we can have our robot perform this behavior until we get bored, and then we can totally reconfigure it. We can build a ground-based version of <a href=\"http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2013/01/an-open-drone-network-vs-closed-logistics-networks.html\">John Robb's DroneNet</a>.</p><p></p><p>Imagine Buffy was at Angel's house last night, and left her keys there. So we give our robot <em>two</em> GPS coordinates, and we add a lockbox with a combination to the top of it. We tell it to go from its current location to the first GPS coordinate, which is Angel's moody pad. Angel puts Buffy's keys in the lockbox, locks it, and hits a \"Deliver\" button on his iPhone. Our software receives that button press, and tells the robot to go to the <em>second</em> GPS coordinate -- Buffy's house -- using all of these sophisticated behaviors we've made as reusable software objects. It makes the delivery, Buffy uses the combination her iPhone told her, unlocks the box, gets her keys, hits \"Received\" on her iPhone, and the robot returns to its home, waiting for its next customer.</p><p></p><p>Same robot, massively different functionality. As long as our robot's motors and sensors and interface -- its physical and autonomic layers -- are in working order, we can keep coming up with cool ways to use it. We can add sensors to it as necessary. We can also reconfigure its hardware so that it moves in more optimized ways -- we can make it a flying drone instead of a rolling drone, for example. But we can still use our GPS \"find me\" behavior, almost independent of <em>how</em> the robot moves from point A to point B. It will require some reconfiguration, but if we've made it modular enough in the first place, that might not be such a big deal to accomplish.</p><p></p><p>We can even allow third-party developers and behavioral networks to access our robot, maybe using something like oAuth. Instead of writing our own behaviors, we entrust our robot to Google's behaviors, because their programmers are smarter than us and they also have a vast network of supercomputers to process our robot's sensorial data and connect it to all the other robots in Google's network. Our robot isn't very smart on its own, but when connected to a behavioral network, it's much smarter...and when its behavior is synced with a lot of other robots, all gathering information and doing things, it's <em>scary</em> smart.</p>",

I'm a software person, essentially, and so I think in those terms.</p><p></p><p>Basically, one of the problems people have had with my idea is that every actuator requires different circuitry, because each one has different power requirements, etc. So one motor might need one set of resistors and capacitors to function correctly, but another one has a totally different set.</p><p></p><p>Which is fine, I totally get that. But that's <em>all </em><em>part of the physical level</em> of my architecture. It doesn't matter <em>how</em> power gets to the motor, so long as it can be regulated by a low-voltage control circuit (i.e. my autonomic level).</p><p></p><p>According to my lazy Googling and some Twitter conversations, there are only really a very few ways for a low-voltage system to control a high-voltage actuator(s). Relay switches, transistors, MOSFETs, right? As long as my autonomic layer has interfaces for all of the usual methods, it doesn't matter what's on the other end of that interface.</p><p></p><p>For example: imagine I have a 50V electric motor in my system. It's turned on by a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_switch\">reed switch</a>, which is 5V, attached to my control board by a standard connector. If I swap out the 50V for a 75V, it doesn't matter to my control circuit at all, because it's just triggering that reed switch. So long as the reed can handle a 75V load, it's all fine. It doesn't matter how the 50V and the 75V each get power from their power supply -- whether they're just connected directly or have more sophisticated management subsystems -- so long as they can be controlled by a binary EM switch or a system for varying power input.</p><p></p><p>Think of it like so:</p><p></p><p><img  src=\"http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/bap.png\" /></p><p></p><p>Each of those physical subsystems (the green and red boxes) can be as complex or as simple as you like, so long as they can be interfaced with my low-voltage autonomic board.</p><p></p><p>So the real project here -- the actual tasks I need to accomplish, as opposed to all my blue-sky philosophical bullshit -- is this:</p><p><ol></p><p><li>Create a standardized way of interfacing the behavioral and autonomic layers. My guess is that this will mean making a way of sending and receiving OSC messages between the two.</li></p><p><li>Create a set of methods for abstracting those messages within the autonomic layer and turning them into actual hardware control signals.</li></p><p><li>Design a standard for normalizing hardware interface and control. I don't think this has to be physical, necessarily, but more like a generalized way of driving different sorts of actuators and reading digital/analog input.</li></p><p></ol></p><p>I think the easiest way to begin this is to write the code for the Arduino, because it's the cheapest and most widely used hardware prototyping hardware around. So my initial concrete goal:</p><p><ol></p><p><li>Write (or find) an OSC receiver for Arduino;</li></p><p><li>Create a set of initial abstractions for components (brushed motors, stepper motors, servos, and analog and digital sensors) that can be mapped to OSC endpoints and methods;</li></p><p><li>Create a machine-readable way of describing those components to the hardware, that can be uploaded to firmware depending upon configuration.</li></p><p></ol></p><p>Once I can get a proof-of-concept working for Arduino, I'll open-source it to anybody who wants to port it to any other control system.</p><p></p><p>So, not a heavy amount of work or anything. ;-)</p>",

            "source": {
                "content": "<p>As I mentioned in my last post, my model for cybernetic systems bears a lot of resemblance to <a href=\"http://www.bcp.psych.ualberta.ca/~mike/Pearl_Street/Dictionary/contents/T/tri-level_hypothesis.html\">David Marr's tri-level hypothesis</a>, which he defines as <strong>computational</strong>, <strong>algorithmic</strong> and <strong>implementational</strong>. I'll quote from the site linked above:</p><p><blockquote>The computational level is a description of what information processing problem is being solved by the system. The algorithmic level is a description of what steps are being carried out to solve the problem. The implementational level is a description of the physical characteristics of the information processing system. There is a one-to-many mapping from the computational level to the algorithmic level,and a one-to-many mapping from the algorithmic level to the implementational level. In other words, there is one computational description of a particular information processing problem, many different algorithms for solving that problem, and many different ways in which a particular algorithm can be physically implemented.</blockquote></p><p>While this is conceptually similar to my idea, Marr is working in purely conceptual space here (though his model can be applied to physical systems as well). My taxonomy is closer to the way an animal works: a cognitive system, a mechanical system, and an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system\">autonomic system</a> for carrying messages between the two. Of course, in animals (at least in humans), this is a strictly hierarchal system: the cognitive system can't directly access the mechanical system, or else you could \"think\" electrical impulses directly to your muscles, for example! But in a technological system, there's no reason you couldn't theoretically directly bypass the autonomic layer entirely, though you wouldn't want to very often, for the same reason you usually don't let desktop software directly control the read/write heads on your hard drive.</p><p></p><p>I see no reason why the majority of low-level sensors and actuators can't be abstracted and made object-oriented. For example, think of object classes in programming. You might have a class called Vehicle, with a set of methods and properties, and a subclass of Vehicle called Bicycle, with overriding methods and properties. Couldn't you do the same thing with hardware control, starting with two classes: Sensor and Actuator? Then you could build sub-classes. A range finder, for example:</p><p><pre>class rangeFinder extends Sensor{</p><p></p><p>public var min = 0; // the minimum value the range finder will send</p><p>public var max = 10000; // the maximum value, which is actually expressed in milliseconds of latency</p><p></p><p>public function latencyToCentimeters{</p><p></p><p>return this.latency * 0.5000 // Or whatever the equation is for converting milliseconds to distance </p><p></p><p>}</p><p></p><p>}</pre></p><p>For example. Then you could declare something like this:</p><p><pre>var rangeThingie = new rangeFinder(01);</pre></p><p>Which would tell your software that there's an object of class Sensor, subclass rangeFinder, at input port 01. (You wouldn't need to specify input vs output, as that's handled by our Sensor object code.)</p><p></p><p>So that's the software abstraction layer...but the hardware still needs to be controlled somehow, right? That's where your programmable autonomic firmware comes in. When you hook up your range finder, you specify the voltage and amperage that it requires, and upload those values to your firmware. (As I mentioned in the last post, this could even be handled by QR or barcodes on the sensor itself; you scan it with your computer's webcam, and it connects to an open database, which returns machine-readable information:</p><p><pre>[type : \"range_sensor\",</p><p>manufacturer: \"Acme, Inc.\",</p><p>specs: {</p><p>voltage: \"5\",</p><p>amps: \".5\"</p><p>min_operational_temperature: \"-50\",</p><p>max_operational_temperature: \"150\"</p><p>}]</pre></p><p>That would be in JSON format, obviously. So your autonomic firmware programmer receives this data and \"knows\" how to interface with this sensor at a mechanical level. Same with any other component: you could send the proper PWM to control a stepper motor (if I understand how stepper motors work, which is not at all certain) or know the maximum amperage you could run through a speaker, or what-have-you.</p><p></p><p>At that point, it's simply a matter of plugging all your components into your autonomic board, giving it specs for each component (by downloading or manually entering them and then uploading that info to the firmware on it), along with any reusable functions you've defined (like \"turnLeft\" or \"rotateElbow\" for robots, as an example) and hooking up your cognitive or behavioral subsystem, which issues commands to the autonomic system.</p><p></p><p>How? Probably using something like the Open Sound Control protocol, which defines a very simple addressing scheme for accessing and sending values to subcomponents. So your software could do something like this:</p><p><pre>var rangeVal = osc.retrieve(\"/robot1/sensors/rangeThingy/\");</p><p></p><p>if(rangeVal &gt; 0.5){</p><p>osc.transmit(\"/robot1/stepperMotors/leftElbow/rotate\", \"45\");</p><p>}</pre></p><p>Which would be translated by the autonomic layer into actual electrical signals. Of course, you could also chain together these specific commands into higher level functions within your behavioral code, or even in your firmware (provided it had enough memory onboard, which is why you might want to use something like an SD card for storing this stuff).</p><p></p><p>How would that code get from the behavioral level to the autonomic level? Doesn't matter. I mean, it <em>matters</em>, but it could be any number of ways:</p><p><ol></p><p><li><span style=\"line-height: 14px;\">The behavioral system is handled by a small computer like a Raspberry PI, physically on-board the device;</span></li></p><p><li>The behavioral system is an actual programmed processor, also on the device;</li></p><p><li>The behavioral system is on a very powerful computer, connected to the device by WiFi or cellular radio, or USB if distance isn't an issue.</li></p><p></ol></p><p>As long as your behavioral level is connected to your autonomic level <em>somehow</em>, the specifics don't matter.</p><p></p><p>So what happens when that connection is severed? If you're smart, you've built fall-back low-level behavior and uploaded it to your autonomic system's storage. Building a drone plane? If it loses its connectivity to the complex control system on the other end of its radio connection, have it continue towards LKG (last known good) destination coordinates, relying on its on-board GPS. Or if that's too risky (say, if you're worried about it running into mountains), have it fly in a circle until it reestablishes connection, or have it try to land without damaging itself. Whatever. It's up to you to figure out the specific fall-back behavior.</p><p></p><p>Roboticists are thinking \"Yes, but my machine is much more efficient than this. I don't care about standardization!\" Yes, your machine might be better and more efficient. But it's also a standalone device. Think of old synthesizers, in the pre-MIDI days; they're hardwired, stuck doing the one thing you made them do. They can't be easily upgraded by the end consumer, they can't be modularized. Your Yamaha DX-7, which was super-badass when you bought it in 1985, is now a curiosity. It's not as good as other, newer digital synths. Nobody wants it...especially when they can replicate its sounds exactly with software now!</p><p></p><p>Same thing if you're building a welding robot (to use an example from a buddy of mine). Your welding robot has all the articulation and parts to weld, but it's not very smart. But if it's interoperable, connective, you don't have to worry about building the logic on-board! Your robot is an avatar for an intelligence that exists separately of the hardware. As people figure out how to make better welding robot routines and procedures, your robot can be updated! It can be made smart! And eventually, when people have figured out better hardware, it can be repurposed to do something else...in the same way that I can use a goofy early 90s hardware synthesizer as an excellent MIDI controller for my newer, better synth software.</p><p></p><p>I realize that a lot of people who work in this side of technology don't think that way, but that's their problem, not mine. I want to figure out a way to make a standard, universal way of connecting hardware to software, one that focuses on simplicity and reproducibility and communication ability over efficiency. I'm repulsed by proprietary systems, and if your business model is based on building things that can't be upgraded but only replaced -- not because they have to be, but because that's where you've decided your revenue stream comes from -- then man, fuck you and your awful business model. Sooner or later, people are going to get sick of your shit and find another vendor...especially when there are cheaper and more flexible alternatives.</p><p></p><p>(Okay, Ellis, breathe. No need to get shouty. Low blood sugar. Go eat something.)</p>",

I'm just trying to get this sorted, so bear with me.</p><p></p><p>A cybernetic system consists of inputs, outputs, and logic to connect them via feedback -- <a href=\"http://www.ifttt.com\" target=\"_blank\">if this, then that</a>. This is true for Web servers and 747 autopilots alike.</p><p></p><p>It occurs to me that you can broadly organize a cybernetic system into three levels of interaction: <strong>behavioral, autonomic</strong> and <strong>mechanical</strong>. So let's look at these in reverse order, from the bottom up.</p><p><ol></p><p><li><strong>Mechanical</strong>: this is the lowest level, below which it's impossible to alter component behavior without external intervention. Think of, for example, a motor. A motor turns, in one direction or another. You can't make it do anything else without actually going in and fucking with its physical properties. Same with a photovoltaic sensor, or a human muscle, which can only contract when sent an electric/chemical signal.</li></p><p><li><strong>Autonomic</strong>: This is the next level up, in which you can connect up inputs and outputs to perform basic logic without need for complex modeling. Imagine a robot with a touch sensor and a motor. You can program the robot to reverse the direction of the motor when the touch sensor is triggered. Or in a biological model, think of your heartbeat. It requires no thought, no interaction: it just beats. You can also think of the BIOS of a computer: it handles the simple, low-level switching of signals between a CPU, RAM, a hard drive, etc.</li></p><p><li><strong>Behavioral</strong>: This is when you hook a bunch of inputs and outputs together and create complex behavior based on their interaction. In computers, this would be the <em>software</em> level of things.</li></p><p></ol></p><p>To give a concrete example of this, think of a <a href=\"http://www.belkin.com/us/wemo\" target=\"_blank\">Belkin WeMo switch</a>. This is a networked-enabled power switch. It has a simple WiFi receiver in it and a relay that can turn power on and off to an electrical socket.</p><p></p><p>The mechanical level of the WeMo is the power socket switch itself. It does one thing: flip a relay. It doesn't \"know\" anything else at all, doesn't <em>do</em> anything else.</p><p></p><p>But the WiFi adds the autonomic level: there's basic logic in the WeMo that when it receives a specific signal over WiFi, it flips that relay. That's <em>all</em> it does (aside from the ability to connect to a WiFi network in the first place). Slightly more complex than the switch itself, but still not complex at all.</p><p></p><p>But then there's the <em>behavioral</em> level of the system. Belkin makes a mobile app for your phone that lets you turn on the switch from wherever you are. In this case, the behavioral level is provided by your own brain: you can turn the light on or off based on a complex system of feedback inside your skull, which takes a various set of inputs, conditions and variables to decide \"Do I want this light on or off?\" It might be overcast outside, or it might be nighttime, and you might want to turn it on; it might be daylight, and you want to turn it off, or it might be dark but you're not home and don't want to waste electricity. Whatever.</p><p></p><p>But here's where it gets interesting: you can use <a href=\"http://www.ifttt.com\" target=\"_blank\">IFTTT</a> to create a \"channel\" for your WeMo, which can be connected up to any other IFTTT channel, allowing for complex interaction without human intervention. For example, I have the WeMo in my living room set to turn on and off based upon Yahoo Weather's API; it turns off when the API says the sun has risen, and turns on when it says the sun has set.</p><p></p><p>This is different than a light controlled by a photovoltaic switch, which is an example of autonomic behavior. The PV switch doesn't \"know\" if the sun has gone down, or if someone is standing in front of it, casting a shadow; all it knows is that its sensor has been blocked, which turns off the light. While this is somewhat useful, it's not nearly as useful as a system with a behavioral level.</p><p></p><p>Make sense?</p><p></p><p>Okay, so let's get back to robots, which was what I was going on about in the last post. A robot is a cybernetic system, and so it has these three potential levels: behavioral, autonomic and mechanical. In the case of a robot, it looks like this:</p><p></p><p>1) <strong>Mechanical</strong>: motors, sensors. A Roomba, to use the example from the last post, has three motors (left wheel, right wheel, vacuum) and a set of touch sensors. All these can do is either receive or send electrical current: when a touch sensor is touched, it sends an electrical signal (or stops sending it, whatever, doesn't matter). A motor receives current in one direction, it turns one way; send it the other direction, it turns the other way.</p><p></p><p>2) <strong>Autonomic</strong>: In our Roomba, this is the hardware logic (probably in a microprocessor) that figures out what to do with the change in current from the touch sensor, and how much current to send to each motor. For example, if the motor is a 100 amp motor and you send 1000 amps through it, you can literally melt it, so make sure it only gets 100 amps no matter what. Very straightforward.</p><p></p><p>3) <strong>Behavioral</strong>: in our Roomba, this is deceptively simple: roll around a room randomly until you've covered all of it, and then stop. In actuality, this requires a pretty serious amount of computation, based upon interaction with the autonomous level: a sensor has been tripped, a motor has been turned on. I don't know the precise behavioral modeling in a Roomba, but I suspect it's conceptually similar to something like Craig Reynold's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids\" target=\"_blank\">boids</a> algorithm: move around until you hit a barrier, figure out where that barrier is (based upon something like number of revolutions of the motor), move away from it until you hit another one, etc.</p><p></p><p>In a Roomba -- and indeed, in most robots -- the autonomic and behavioral levels are hard-coded and stored within the robot itself. A Roomba can't follow any instructions, save the ones that are hardcoded into the firmware in its processor.</p><p></p><p>Fine. But what if we thought about this in another way?</p><p></p><p>Let's remove the Roomba's behavioral subsystem entirely. Let's replace it with a black box that takes wireless signals from a WiFi or cellular network; doesn't matter which. This black box receives these signals and converts them to signals the autonomic subsystem can understand: turn this motor this fast for this long, turn that motor off. And let's even add some simple autonomic functions: if no signals have been received for X milliseconds, switch to standby mode.</p><p></p><p>Our Roomba is suddenly much more interesting. Let's imagine a Roomba \"channel\" on IFTTT. If I send a Tweet to an account I've set up for my Roomba, I can turn it on and off remotely. Cool, but not <em>that</em> cool, right?</p><p></p><p>But what if we add the following behavior: let's make our Roomba play Marco Polo. Let's give it a basic GPS unit, so it can tell us where it is. Then let's give it the following instructions:</p><p></p><p>1) Here's a set of GPS coordinates, defined by two values. Compare them to your own GPS coordinates.</p><p></p><p>2) Roll around for a minute in different directions, until you can figure out which direction decreases the difference between these two coordinate points.</p><p></p><p>3) Roll in that direction.</p><p></p><p>4) When you encounter an obstacle, try rolling away from it, generally in the direction you know will decrease the difference between your coordinate and your target coordinate. If you have to roll in another direction, fine, but keep bumping into things until you've found a route that decreases the difference rather than increasing it.</p><p></p><p>This is a very simple and relatively easy set of instructions to implement. And when we do so, we've got a Roomba that will <em>come and find us</em>, bouncing around by trial and error until it does so. It might take thirty seconds, it might take hours, but the Roomba will eventually find us.</p><p></p><p>Now, if we equip the Roomba with more complex sensors like a range finder or a Leap Motion, this all becomes much more efficient: the Roomba can \"scan\" the room and determine the quickest, least obstacle-filled path. In fact, the Roomba itself, the hardware, doesn't have to do this at all: it can send the data from its sensors over its wireless connection to a much more complicated computer which can calculate all of this stuff for it, much faster, and issue commands to it.</p><p></p><p>But what happens if that network connection breaks down? In this case, we can give the Roomba a very simple autonomic routine to follow: if there's no instructions coming, either stop and wait until a connection is reestablished, or resort to the initial behavior: bump around trying to reduce the difference between your own GPS coordinate and the one you've got stored in your memory. Once a connection is reestablished, start listening to <em>it</em> instead.</p><p></p><p>If this sounds dumb, well, imagine this: you're in an unfamiliar city. You're relying on your car's GPS to navigate from your hotel to your meeting. When you're halfway there, your GPS stops working (for whatever reason). You know your meeting is at 270 34th Street, and you know that you're at 1800 57th Street. (The numbered streets in this imaginary city run east-west.) So you know you need to go east for fifteen blocks or so, and north for twenty-three blocks. So you turn left and go north on Oak Street, but Oak Street deadends at 45th Street. So you turn right onto 45th until you find Elm Street, the next north-south street, and you turn left and continue to 34th Street, where you turn right and keep going until you reach the 200 block.</p><p></p><p>Do you see where I'm going with this? You're doing exactly what our imaginary Roomba is doing: you're \"bumping\" into obstacles while reducing the difference between your Cartesian coordinate and the coordinate of your destination. The difference is that you're not <em>literally</em> bumping into things (at least hopefully), but if our Roomba has sophisticated enough range finders and such, neither is it.</p><p></p><p>But this is even more interesting, because we can break <em>your</em> behavior down into the same three levels.</p><p><ol></p><p><li><strong>Behavioral</strong>: I want to go to 270 W. 34st Street. My brain is converting this idea into a set of complex behaviors that mainly involve turning a wheel with my arms and pushing pedals with my feet. And hopefully also paying attention to the environment around me.</li></p><p><li><strong>Autonomic</strong>: I think \"I need to turn left\", and my brain automatically converts this to a series of actions: rotate my arms at such an angle, move my knee up and down at a certain speed and pressure. As Julian Jaynes points out in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origin_of_Consciousness_in_the_Breakdown_of_the_Bicameral_Mind\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Origin Of Consciousness In The Breakdown Of The Bicameral Mind</em></a>, these are not conscious actions. If you actually sat down and <em>thought</em> about every physical action you needed to do to drive a car, you couldn't get more than a block.</li></p><p><li><strong>Mechanical</strong>: Your limbic system sends electricity to your muscles, which do things.</li></p><p></ol></p><p>Your muscles don't need to \"know\" where you're going, why you're going there, or even how to drive a car. Your higher mental functions (<em>I need to turn left, ooh, there's a Starbucks, I could use some coffee, shit, I'm already late though</em>) don't deal with applying signals to your muscles. The autonomic systems are the go-between.</p><p></p><p>But then, something happens: a <a href=\"http://i.qkme.me/3ovf1h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">dumbass in an SUV</a> whips out in front of you. At that point, your behavioral system suspends and your autonomic system kicks in: <em>hit the brakes</em>! You don't have to consciously think about it, and if you did, you'd be dead. It just sort of <em>happens</em>. (There are actually lots of these direct-action triggers wired into human mental systems. Flinching is another example. It is almost impossible not to flinch if something comes into your vision from the periphery unexpectedly, moving very fast.)</p><p></p><p>So let's turn this into a brilliant architecture for robotics. (He said, modestly and not confusingly at all.)</p><p></p><p>Our architecture consists of our three levels: behavioral, autonomic and mechanical. However, because we're building modular robots and not monolithic people, what each of these actually <em>means</em> can be swapped out and changed. Again, let's look at this from the bottom up.</p><p></p><p>1) <strong>Mechanical.</strong> This can be pretty much any set of sensors and actuators: a potentiometer, a button, a touch sensor, a photovoltaic sensor. Doesn't matter. To an electron, a motor and a speaker look exactly the same. You can actually simply imagine this as <a href=\"http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoMotorShieldR3\" target=\"_blank\">a whole bunch of Molex connectors on a circuitboard</a> with a basic BIOS built-in. What we hook into them is kind of irrelevant, as our <em>autonomic</em> system will handle this.</p><p></p><p>2) <strong>Autonomic.</strong> this is a combination of hardware and updatable firmware. Think of a reprogrammable microprocessor, perhaps with a small bit of RAM or SSD storage attached to it. The hardware simply interprets signals from the behavioral level and sends them to our mechanical level; the firmware handles the specific details. So let's imagine we've plugged two motors into our circuitboard and a heat sensor. We then tell the firmware how much voltage to send to the motors, and what range of voltage we expect from the heat sensor. It then normalizes these values by mapping them to a floating point number between 0 and 1. (This is just an example of how you could do this.)</p><p></p><p>So let's say our heat sensor sends temperature in degrees Celsius, with a maximum of 200 and a minimum of -50. Our autonomic system converts that to a 0-1 range, where 0 is -50 and 200 is 1. Therefore, if the temperature is 125 degrees Celsius, it sends a value of 0.5. Make sense?</p><p></p><p>Same with the motors. If the motor's maximum RPM is 2500 (and minimum is obviously zero), if we send a message like \"rotateMotor(0.5)\" to our autonomic level, it \"knows\" to send the amount of current that will turn the motor at 1250 RPM. (This can get a bit more complicated, but for our purposes, this is a basic example.)</p><p></p><p>The point is, the actual physical operating ranges of our components <em>don't matter at all</em>; that's easily mappable to standardized value ranges by our autonomic system.</p><p></p><p>We can program the firmware based upon the mechanical stuff we have connected, so we can swap our components out at any time. We can also create simple programmable autonomic \"behaviors\", which are preprogrammed instruction sets. One might be: if the heat sensor (which we've mounted at the front of our robot) gets above 0.5, turn both motors counterclockwise at amount 1 until the sensor's value goes down to .25. This means that when our robot senses temperatures at 125º C or higher, it will run away until the temperature goes down to 62.5º C. This allows us to not worry about basic things like self-preservation. We can even make this behavior slightly more complex: for example, we can use motors that can send back the amount of torque to the autonomic level. If the torque is too high, the motor stops doing what it's doing.</p><p></p><p>We can also create simple shortcuts, like \"turn left\" or \"go forward by 500 feet\". These shortcuts can be translated by the autonomic level into hardware specific commands. For example, if we know our motor turns at 2500 RPM and we know that 5 revolutions will move it one foot, when our autonomic system receives the command \"go forward by 500 feet\", it translates that into the command \"turn on for 60000 milliseconds, or one minute\", which is sent to the motor.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the autonomic level acts like our limbic system, freeing our robot's \"higher brain\" from having to worry about any of the tedious hardware interfacing shit.</p><p></p><p>And again, this doesn't have to be oriented towards robotics. We can make an autonomic level that sends electricity through a speaker at a certain frequency when a certain button is pushed, which becomes a very simple musical synthesizer. It's all just input and output. Just current.</p><p></p><p>If we've done our job correctly, we can now move on to the behavioral level of our device.</p><p></p><p>3) <strong>Behavioral.</strong> The behavioral level, in hardware terms, is a black box: it can either be an onboard CPU (like a Raspberry PI, for example) or a network connection, like in our imaginary Roomba. Doesn't matter, as far as the rest of the system is concerned, <em>as long as it sends commands that our autonomic system can understand</em>. These can either be higher-level (\"turn left\") or lower-level (\"turn on motor #3 for eight milliseconds, pause for fifteen milliseconds, then turn on motor #5 for one hundred milliseconds, or until sensor #5 trips, in which case start the whole thing over again\"). The logic for our behavioral system can be anything we like, provided we have a complex enough processor onboard or in the cloud. In fact, it doesn't have to be either/or: we can build a behavioral center with half of its behaviors onboard and half in the cloud, or any variation thereof -- like our Roomba, which stumbles around blindly until it's given commands by the cloud. It depends upon the requirements of the tasks our device is made to carry out.</p><p></p><p>With a structure like this, we can easily build a simple \"brain\" for a robot that can essentially be connected to damn near any set of sensors and actuators and perform an infinite number of tasks, so long as the right sensors and actuators are connected to it. Such a robot could be anything from a simple <a href=\"http://www.romotive.com\" target=\"_blank\">Romotive</a>-style consumer toy to a drone tank in a war zone to a telemedical surgical robot, performing neurosurgery while controlled by a doctor miles away. It doesn't even have to be a robot, actually: it can be a synthesizer or a video game controller or an interface for driving the drone tank or performing the neurosurgery. I cannot stress this enough: it's all just electricity, going to and from mechanical bits.</p><p></p><p>And herein lies the difficult part, which is not technical but organizational: this relies upon software and hardware standards, two things which the engineering industry seems simply incapable of deciding upon until forced at gunpoint. There is no standard way of connecting motors to sensors, no universal format for describing an actuator's mechanical behavior (voltage, amperage, torque, maximum speed, operational temperature range, etc.). Nor is there any standard API or language protocol that can be implemented between the behavioral and autonomic layers. There are existing analogies in hardware/software interfacing: the first two that pop into mind are the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_human_interface_device_class\" target=\"_blank\">USB Human Interface Device standard</a> and MIDI, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midi\" target=\"_blank\">Musical Instrument Digital Interface protocol</a> which allows interoperability between synthesizers. (In point of fact, a number of non-musical devices like 3D motion capture systems <a href=\"http://www.sonalog.com/\" target=\"_blank\">incorporate MIDI as their input/output system</a>, which is a square peg banged into a round hole, but which suggests that such a standard is probably about thirty years overdue.)</p><p></p><p>Think of your computer's mouse, or your trackpad perhaps if you're using a laptop. There are a few different methods of building a mouse: mechanical, optical, or in the case of touchpads, capacitive. A mouse can move around, or it can be stationary (as with a trackball). And when I was a kid, a mouse required a software driver that came on a floppy disk when you bought it.</p><p></p><p>But at some point, somebody realized that the actual mechanics of any given mouse were just completely goddamn irrelevant from a software perspective, because every mouse -- no matter how it works -- just sends back two bits of information: X and Y position. So the people who make mice figured out a standard, in which a mouse sends that positional coordinate over USB in a standard way, which is called \"class compliance\". How it converted motion into that coordinate -- whether it used two rollers or a laser -- was handled at the autonomic level, by the tiny chip inside the mouse.</p><p></p><p>So now, when you buy a mouse, you plug it in and it works. Any mouse manufacturer who attempted to build a mouse that wasn't USB class compliant would very quickly go out of business. It would be pointless. There are lots of wonderful improvements in mouse design, I guess, and probably entire conventions full of engineering nerds who get together and get drunk in hotels and talk animatedly about lasers versus capacitance. But nobody else gives a shit. We've sorted the irritating part out.</p><p></p><p>And yet, the people who make robots are still reinventing the wheel, every single time, despite the fact that no robot is anything more than a collection of sensors and actuators, held together in ways that are really fascinating if you're a structural engineer and completely irrelevant if you're just trying to write software that controls robots. It's all just <em>motors</em>, even if there are lots and lots of them and they're connected in extremely intricate ways. You're just sending and receiving current.</p><p></p><p>Imagine a standardization scheme where you, the aspiring roboticist, could purchase a set of motors and sensors and bring them home. Each one might have a QR code printed on it or an RFID attached to it; you could scan the code, and your computer would retrieve all of the pertinent information about the mechanism. You could then plug it into your autonomic interface, tell your computer which mechanism was at which port, and your computer would then prepare the firmware and dump it into the system. You could then attach a CPU or network interface to the autonomic board, and within minutes your robot would be active and alive, behaving in any fashion you liked.</p><p></p><p>Commercially-sold robots -- with perhaps complex and delicate assemblies that would be difficult for you to make at home -- would have pre-existing complex autonomic systems, with software that allowed you to \"train\" them, or purchase downloadable \"personalities\", which would simply be pre-existing behavioral methods. Tinkerers could modify and customize the behavior of their robots using standard APIs, which could even have safety limits set in place so that you couldn't accidentally short your robot or blow out its motor, unless you were sophisticated enough to bypass the API (and the autonomic system) and control the mechanical bits directly.</p><p></p><p>If robot manufacturers adopted this model, we would begin to see a true Golden Age of robotics, I think. We would begin to see emergent complexity at a far faster speed than is currently displayed, because anybody could build and train robots, and link them together, and let them not only act but interact, learn from each other, and contribute to and benefit from collective knowledge and action.</p><p></p><p>Now, if only we could convince engineers to get their shit together.</p>",

                "content": "<p>This afternoon, I attended an excellent talk by <a href=\"http://goldberg.berkeley.edu/\">Ken Goldberg</a> about \"cloud robotics\" -- the idea of building robots that are essentially taught and controlled by the Internet \"cloud\". As Ken was talking, I had a moment of pure epiphany about cloud robotics and the \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things\">Internet of things</a>\". I realized that the underlying assumptions about how this should all work are completely wrong.</p><p></p><p>First, a bit of a summary: in the traditional model, a robot is an autonomous (or semi-autonomous) object. Its behavior is pre-programmed into it, and it's set loose to do whatever it does: build automobile chassis, or roll around your house vacuuming until it's gotten every bit of the floor. These sorts of robots are extremely limited, because they can only deal with whatever it is they're programmed to do in the first place. Your <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roomba\">Roomba</a> is very good at vacuuming your rug, but if it encounters a Coke can on the rug, it doesn't know what to do with it -- it either ignores it or it runs away in a robot's version of existential dread.</p><p></p><p>\"Cloud\" robotics refers to the idea of robotic systems in which the behavior modeling is offloaded onto the Internet. A perfect example is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_driverless_car\">Google's self-driving car</a>, which is absolutely incapable of driving itself around the most sedate of suburban neighborhoods without a constant connection to Google's servers, which are processing the data from the car's sensors and comparing it to maps and predicated behavior and reporting back to the car, adjusting its actions accordingly. In this sense, the self-driving car isn't self-driving at all. There is no direct human intervention, but in a very real sense, it's Google's servers that are behind the wheel.</p><p></p><p>There's a lot of work being done in this area, to make robots smarter and in less need of human intervention. Ken talked about the idea, for example, of a robot that uploads pictures of an unfamiliar item to the cloud, which interprets the picture, deciphers what the object is, and returns instructions to the robot on how to deal with it. If algorithms break down, we can even foresee a future in which robots \"call in\" to humans, who \"tell\" the robot how best to proceed.</p><p></p><p>This is all well and good and presents a rosy future, but the fact is that at the moment this is all a fantasy. Right now, there's no standard way for robots to communicate with the cloud, and even if there were, there's no standard way for that communication to be translated into action. Every robot works differently, every robot design is unique; one would have to write an entire software stack to deal with each and every model of robot.</p><p></p><p>In fact, robots in 2013 are very much like musical synthesizers were, up until the late 1980s. This is a digression, but bear with me.</p><p></p><p>If I showed up on the doorstep of a forward-thinking musician in 1979 or so and asked them to define a synthesizer, they'd tell me that it was an electronic device that made sounds. Synths were <em>boxes</em>, with a \"brain\" which took signals from an input controller -- usually, but not always, a piano-style keyboard -- and turned them into audio signals that were sent to an output (usually a speaker or a mixing board for recording). Though the principles of synthesis were pretty much the same, every synth went about it in a different way: the \"brain\" of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moog_synthesizer\">Moog</a> was totally different from that of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buchla#Buchla.27s_unique_synthesizer_designs\">Buchla</a>, for example, and in many cases they even handled the input from their keyboards totally differently. Everyone was, not so much reinventing the wheel, but inventing their <em>own</em> wheel.</p><p></p><p>It occurred to somebody in the late 1970s that it would be really useful if you could control multiple synths from the same keyboard, or even figure out a way to record a series of notes that could be \"played back\" on a synth live, to allow much more complicated music than could be performed by a single person with one or even two keyboards. But at the time, there was no real way to accomplish this, due to the <em>sui generis</em> nature of every synth.</p><p></p><p>A lot of goofy hacks and kludges were invented to solve this problem -- including devices that sat atop the keyboards of different synths and physically pressed the notes, using solenoids -- until a group of nerds invented something called MIDI, or Musical Instrument Digital Interface, in the early 1980s -- a protocol for allowing synthesizers to communicate amongst one another that is still the de facto standard today.</p><p></p><p>The entire MIDI protocol is too complex to get into here, but the gist of it is that a MIDI-enabled device can send or receive basically three instructions: turn X note on on channel Y at Z volume; turn X note off on channel Y; and send X value on channel Y to controller Z. That, a bunch of wanky technical details aside, is basically it! And while MIDI has its very serious limitations, it's the basis of at least 50% of the musical sounds you hear every single day -- from the ravey keyboard lead in Lady Gaga's \"Bad Romance\" to the Hammond organ sound on your favorite indie track to the deep beats on Kanye's new jam.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the ability for one synth to talk to another, MIDI allowed something else entirely: the ability to separate the input device from the output device. To our musician in 1979, a \"synth\" was a monolithic physical object; but in the 1980s, you began to see synth \"brains\" without keyboards and keyboards without brains that could be connected using standard MIDI protocols (and cables). And as desktop computers became more powerful, a \"synthesizer\" could just as easily refer to a piece of software, controlled by an <a href=\"http://www.korg.com/SupportPage.aspx?productid=415\">inexpensive MIDI keyboard controller</a> that sends MIDI signals over USB, as a big box sitting on your desk. In fact, you don't even need a human performer at all; one of my hobbies is writing little apps that algorithmically generate MIDI commands and send them to my software synths. (I've actually released two of the <a href=\"http://redstatesoundsystem.bandcamp.com/track/tully-goes-down-to-the-docks\">resulting</a> <a href=\"http://redstatesoundsystem.bandcamp.com/track/what-right-do-we-have\">tracks</a> commercially, and they've sold surprisingly well.)</p><p></p><p>Ask a musician in 2013 what a \"synth\" is, and they're not likely to describe a big physical box to you; they're more likely to tell you <a href=\"http://www.moogmusic.com/products/Apps\">it's an app</a> that runs on their laptop or their iPad.</p><p></p><p>The monolithic, in other words, has become modular.</p><p></p><p>By contrast, ask an engineer in 2013 what a \"robot\" is, and they'll tell you it's a machine that can be programmed to carry out physical tasks. A robot looks like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WALL-E\">Wall-E</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asimo\">Asimo</a>: it's a <em>thing</em>, a discrete physical object.</p><p></p><p>But this is both a simplification and an overcomplication. A robot can just as easily be defined as a collection of input and output devices, or, if you prefer, \"sensors\" and \"actuators\", connected by a cybernetic controller. The sensors take in data from the world; the cybernetic controller interprets the data, and makes the output devices do things, upon which the whole cycle begins again, in a feedback loop.</p><p></p><p>For example: a Roomba is, when you get right down to it, a collection of touch sensors hooked up to three motors (one to turn each of the two wheels, and one to turn the fan that actually vacuums stuff up) via a \"brain\". When a given touch sensor sends a strong enough signal (via running into a wall or a cat or an ottoman), the brain makes the wheels change direction or speed; for the most part, the vacuum fan isn't involved in this process at all, but keeps happily chugging away until the Roomba is turned off.</p><p></p><p>The value of these sensors and actuators broadly follows Metcalfe's Law: each by itself is essentially useless, but when connected together -- along with something to sort out the data from the sensors and decide what commands to send to the actuators -- they become far more valuable than the sum of their parts. They become a \"robot\".</p><p></p><p>But here's the thing: they're still just parts. We call them a \"robot\" when they're put into a chassis together, but that's just limited imagination on our part.</p><p></p><p>Let's try something else instead. Let's take all those components out of that little round chassis and reconfigure them entirely. Let's mount the touch sensors into a console and call them by a slightly different name: \"buttons\". (Because that is, in fact, what they are.) Let's put those motors into the wings of a very light aircraft, to control the flaps and ailerons that adjust the aircraft's movement in the air. And instead of a hardware chip, let's give them something more akin to a nervous system, that sends and receives signals -- using radio, for example.</p><p></p><p>When you push the buttons, those signals are sent via radio to the motors, which -- when combined together -- move the airplane up and down and left to right. What you have now is a radio-controlled plane!</p><p></p><p>But let's get more interesting. Let's add a brain back in, but instead of that stupid simple chip, let's do what the synth people did, and move it into software. After all, our laptop is a thousand times more powerful than the little microprocessor that used to be our Roomba's tiny brain, right? And let's swap out our touch sensors, our buttons, for another sensor: a GPS unit.</p><p></p><p>Now, we can use the infinite power of our laptop to take the simple signals from the GPS and translate them into simple instructions to our motors, which really can only go on and off. If the X coordinate of the GPS is too low, turn on the tail motor for two seconds (or if it's a servomotor, by Z degrees). Once the X coordinate is right, turn it the other way.</p><p></p><p>Let's make it more interesting. Let's use Google Maps to get the precise GPS coordinates of an arbitrary address, and send that as a reference point for our two motors. (We've taken the fan motor and used it to turn the propeller on our plane, but it's still stupid and only needs to turn on when we begin and turn off when we're done.)</p><p></p><p>Now we can simply type a street address into our interface, sit back, and wait for our Roomba to get there. Only it's not a Roomba anymore, is it? Is it even a robot at all? It's the same collection of sensors and actuators (well, almost). It's doing the same thing -- taking input, processing it, and using that processed data to control output.</p><p></p><p>A \"robot\" is merely our convenient placeholder for an arbitrary collection of sensors and actuators. There's a certain amount of anthropomorphism in that: a \"robot\" is a thing, like a \"person\". But the difference is that each of the active parts of a robot -- the sensors and actuators -- can, in fact, be addressed and controlled individually. If that input and output is coordinated by a subtle and complex system -- a \"brain\" -- each simple input and output can become a remarkably advanced robot indeed...the same way a synthesizer becomes much more powerful and versatile and capable of producing amazing things when you <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenharp\">stop thinking of it</a> as a piano keyboard with a box attached to it.</p><p></p><p>But that convenient placeholder -- \"robot\" -- has become a trap. Robots in 2013 are like synths in 1975 -- each one is <em>sui generis</em>, each manufacturer reinvents the wheel. Every model of robot has a different onboard operating system, a different way of connecting input to output, a different protocol. And yet, how many actual types of actuators even exist? Rotary motors, linear motors, solenoids, pistons...almost every actuator in every robot on Earth is based on a set of mechanical devices which were pretty well understood by the end of the Second World War. And all of them operate by the same rough principle: send X amount of current for Y amount of time. (Or send X amount of current at Y frequency for Z amount of time, if you're talking about pulse width modulation-based components.)</p><p></p><p>Inputs? Slightly more complicated, but as we've seen with computer peripherals, it's perfectly possible to standardize even the most complex of inputs, provided we're willing to offload the processing to software. That's why there are USB standard protocols for everything from computer mice to webcams to yes, even MIDI devices. Webcams may have different resolutions and color depths, but they're still just sending an array of pixel data to software.</p><p></p><p>What if we stopped thinking of and designing robots as monolithic objects, but started thinking of them as useful collections of components? And designed simple protocols for sending and retrieving their sensor and actuator data to their brain or nervous system -- protocols that could be standardized and given APIs and made replicable, as well as transmitting unique information about the robot when it connects? (USB-MIDI synths and controllers do this; when you connect one, it sends its model name and manufacturer to the MIDI-handling subsystem of the operating system. If you have a Mac, go to Applications-&gt;Utilities-&gt;Audio MIDI Setup and plug a cheap USB-MIDI controller in; you'll see what I mean.)</p><p></p><p>Imagine a Bluetooth robot that, when paired with a computing device, sends an addressed list of its sensors and actuators to the client software, maybe like this:</p><p><ul></p><p><li></p><p><pre>0 :: rotary motor :: \"leftTread\"</p><p>1 :: rotary motor :: \"rightTread\"</p><p>2 :: servomotor :: \"robotArmElbow\"</pre></p><p></li></p><p></ul></p><p>I'm just making that up off the top of my head, but you see what I mean. Or you could provide the developer with a list of endpoints; this is similar to the way that MIDI hardware synths come with manuals that show which controllers handle what, like \"CC42: Filter Frequency\". (This lets you, the musician, know that if you assign the knob on your MIDI controller to CC42, when you turn it, it will adjust the filter frequency of your hardware synth.)</p><p></p><p>This would allow the creation of simple network protocols for interacting with sensors and actuators, in which the business logic is offloaded to the cloud or a controller device. For example, imagine this bit of pseudocode:</p><p><pre>while(robot1/pressureSensor &lt; 20){</p><p>        robot1/leftTread.rotate(20);</p><p>}</pre></p><p>It doesn't <em>matter</em> what the actual value range sent by <code>robot1/pressureSensor</code> is, in this simple example, so long as the cloud \"knows\" the proper range; it could be 0 to 1 or 0 to 255 or 0 to the distance from the Earth to the moon in micrometers. The same with the tread motor, or the servo, or the solenoid. It doesn't matter any more than it matters to the HTML renderer in your browser whether you type a two word declaration or a 500 word soliloquy into your Facebook status box; the client-side takes care of all the tricky bits of displaying your text and converting it into POST data and sending the data to be processed on the server-side.</p><p></p><p>If every actuator/sensor became separately addressable, with all of the coordination between them being handled by higher-level computing devices, the whole notion of the \"robot\" ceases to exist. It's just components, some of which are physically joined, some of which are not, connected by routers. A camera on a pole could provide data that tells forklift robots how to coordinate their movement; a light sensor could tell all of the automated blinds on the east side of your house to roll themselves down when the sun rises...while also telling your coffeemaker to power on and start brewing your coffee; if the Weather Channel's API says it's going to be cold, your car automatically turns on the window defroster before you get in and turn on the engine.</p><p></p><p>The whole world, in effect, becomes one giant robot, a billion different actuators driven by a billion different sensors, all linked up and connected by the cloud. Nor do the \"actuators\" or the sensors need necessarily be physical; again, we're moving away from the idea of the robot as a device that does physical work. A robot that bangs a drum whenever you send a Tweet to a specific account is still a robot, right?</p><p></p><p>In fact, a roboticist of 2033 might think of a \"robot\" as a \"set of behaviors that drive physical devices\", rather than as the physical devices themselves. One can even imagine different robotic \"social networks\", where you can hook your devices up to a specific cloud that suits your tastes and needs. The military would have their cloud, businesses would have intranet clouds to control their industrial robots; you might connect your \"hardware cloud\" of sensors and actuators up to a \"software cloud\" that learns behaviors from your friends and family.</p><p></p><p>It's difficult to fully imagine this scenario, of course. And what I'm describing here isn't easy. It requires a complete rethinking of how we design and envision robots -- from monolithic to modular. But this transition is something that every aspect of technology seems to go through at some point, from industrialization to communications to computation, and even, as we've seen, music technology. I believe it's a necessary paradigm shift.</p><p></p><p>What we're doing is nothing less than making the world around us come to life, to act and react according to the information we create and share. In order to truly make that happen, we need to teach our devices to share as well.</p>",

            "name": "On the death of netbooks.",
            "source": {
                "content": "<p>This week, Acer and <a href=\"http://pandodaily.com/2013/01/02/as-ereaders-and-netbooks-fall-good-enough-goes-with-them/\" target=\"_blank\">ASUS announced they'd be halting production of their netbook lines</a>...which means, because they were the last major producers of netbooks, that the form factor is all but dead.</p><p></p><p>Ironically, I expensed a cheap netbook the day before yesterday -- a Gateway, which actually means an Acer, because Acer owns Gateway now. I bought it because I need to be able to test NSFWCORP HTML on Internet Explorer 9...and even with my relatively new and fast MacBookPro, running Windows 7 or 8 in VirtualBox slows everything down so badly I can't even switch over to edit code easily.</p><p></p><p>Hence the netbook, which is small enough to throw in my bag along with my MBP so that I can test code on the go. But I <em>also</em> installed Ubuntu on it, because I wanted the ability to actually <em>use</em> it, and I refuse to use Windows if I can help it.</p><p></p><p>My primary go-to device these days is my iPad, with a Bluetooth keyboard attached. There are days when I don't even ever open my MacBook, because I can do 90% of what I need to do with the iPad. I've got <a href=\"http://www.textasticapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Textastic</a> installed, which allows me to do basic code editing on the fly, and <a href=\"http://www.zinger-soft.com/iSSH_features.html\" target=\"_blank\">iSSH</a>, which lets me login to my server and do basic stuff.</p><p></p><p>But the keyword here is <em>basic</em>. Almost every tablet out there -- not to mention smartphone -- is designed around the act of <em>consumption</em>, not <em>production</em>. It's very easy to surf the Web, do social networking, watch movies, etc. with your iPad...but it's annoyingly difficult to do anything involving text editing with it. It's actually easier for me to record and write music with my iPad than it is for me to write rich-formatted text. Apple has crippled their devices in ways that make it hard to get shit done with them.</p><p></p><p>And it <em>is</em> crippling, make no mistake. It's not technically complicated to allow Pages to use standard keyboard shortcuts to italicize text, for example...but Apple has chosen not to do this. Instead, you have to reach up, tap the screen, drag to select the word or phrase you want to italicize, then tap the pop-up context menu twice to get to the <em>I</em> button. This is profoundly irritating if you're writing very large chunks of text.</p><p></p><p>Textastic does a fantastic job of accommodating coders with the limitations of iOS, but it's still really irritating to try and do anything serious with it, because of Apple's arbitrary blocks on file system access and modifying the default keyboard behavior.</p><p></p><p>Also, a mouse. Touch is great for on-the-go, but if you've ever tried to use a  touchscreen simultaneously with a keyboard, you know what I mean. It's dreadful and slow and clunky.</p><p></p><p>Which is where the netbook comes in. I really love the netbook form factor. It's compact, but it doesn't sacrifice physical usability for slickness or \"ease of use\" (and oh, the irony there). You've got your keyboard, your mouse, and a real, full-fledged operating system.</p><p></p><p>The only real problem with netbooks, for me, is their terrible lack of power. Using the mainstream flavor of Ubuntu 12.4 LTS on the Gateway is maddening. It takes thirty seconds for anything to open. I'm going to wipe it off and replace it with one of the stripped-down Ubuntu variants (like Kubuntu or Edubuntu) to see if that improves things, because as it stands it's nearly unusable.</p><p></p><p>The conventional wisdom is that the netbook was killed by two suspects: tablets and the MacBook Air. I suspect that's true, because it split the netbook's market into two factions: people who wanted a cheap portable computing device that was larger than a smartphone, and people who wanted a small, light, full-powered laptop.</p><p></p><p>But it also leaves a gap: people who want a cheap, small, full-powered laptop. The MacBook Air is still about a thousand dollars, which is outside most people's range for buying an inexpensive portable device. The tablets are cheap, but can't do what a laptop does. Netbooks were a nice compromise.</p><p></p><p>I also see their demise as a worrying step on the tabletization of desktops and laptops. I have a terrible suspicion -- based on OS X Mountain Lion's added features -- that Apple is trying to merge MacOS and iOS into one unified operating system, which would be absolutely horrifying. I don't need or want and won't accept a goddamn cell phone OS on my computer. I want MacOS's power and flexibility. Unlike Linux, it's usable out of the box with the major apps I need. Unlike Windows, it's secure and stable and has UNIX underpinnings. Unlike both, it's gorgeous and easy to use.</p><p></p><p>I hoped for a long time that Apple would launch a lower-end OS X netbook (perhaps as a reboot of the old iBook line), or at least extend the capabilities of iOS on the iPad to include more advanced features (without requiring jailbreaking). But I suppose Acer and ASUS's announcements mean I'll never see that. It's a shame.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Back then I had no idea about \"weblog\" software, so I wrote my own, which allowed me to make very simple HTML posts.</p><p></p><p>Over the last few years, the site has stagnated, as I've turned to other outlets for my ranting (mainly Twitter). But it occurs to me that it might be interesting to someone out there for me to resume cataloging my daily ideas, interests and links.</p><p></p><p>So here's my New Year's resolution: to try and write something here at least once a day, even if it's only a single thought or link; specifically, something I haven't posted anywhere else.</p><p></p><p>Here goes: I'm currently deeply fascinated by the idea of <em>micropower</em>: systems for self-generating electrical energy (usually in small amounts). This could be solar panels, windmills, or kinetically-generated power, like hand-cranked generators.</p><p></p><p>My current interest began with this:</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>This light can be charged by pulling down on a weighted cord, which I assume turns a dynamo or something similar to power the LED within. One pull equals a half-hour of light. Other devices can also be powered from this gravity light, like cellphones. (I'm interested in what they're using to store the power -- a normal deep-charge battery will lose its charging ability if it's partially charged extremely often. My guess is a shallow-charge battery, like a car uses, or some sort of capacitance system. But that's a guess.)</p><p></p><p>I've been looking at ways to modify car alternators to be human-powered as well; more to come on that soon.</p>",

            "source": {
                "content": "<p>Tomorrow, I'm flying to Chicago to pick up a van that Rosalie's aunt is very kindly giving us (we haven't had a car in a while). I'll be driving the van back, which is a 2100 mile drive, at least on the route I'm taking, which will take me from freezing, possibly snowing Chicago, all the way through the Ozarks, the north Texas prairie where I grew up, and the mountains and deserts of New Mexico and Arizona. So I need to pack for <em>versatility</em>.</p><p></p><p>I've traveled quite a lot in my life -- less so in the past few years, but a lot more than your average American. Consequently, I've developed specific algorithms for what to pack.</p><p></p><p>My first rule is: black t-shirts. I always have at least 1.25x as many black t-shirts as the number of days I'll be gone. Black t-shirts are incredibly versatile -- you can wear them under a sportcoat in a pinch, they don't advertise stains, and you can roll them up for additional space. In this case, I don't know exactly how long it'll take me to drive home, so I'm taking six t-shirts, just in case.</p><p></p><p>Always take at least one or two collared, button-up shirts, just in case. In case of what? <em>Exactly</em>.</p><p></p><p>Pants: nice jeans. One pair per day, generally, but in this case I'm driving solo, and frankly I'm only taking three or four pairs this trip. A pair of light shorts for hanging out in hotel rooms, in case you need to step out to get something from the vending machine. And they double as swim trunks, if you need 'em.</p><p></p><p>Shoes and socks: I only travel wearing Doc Martens. Not steel toes, if you're traveling in cold places -- trust my bitter experience on that. However, I also take a pair of cheap flip-flops, which I wear to the airport to speed up security. Also good for hotel rooms.</p><p></p><p>Socks: always carry lots of socks. For this trip, I have three pairs of heavy socks and four pairs of light athletic ones.</p><p></p><p>Toiletries: I just shaved my head, so I don't need shampoo and conditioner. I always carry my old-fashioned double razor, shaving cream, toothbrush and floss and toothpaste. If you're staying in hotels or motels, they'll have soap.</p><p></p><p>Weapons: This may not apply to you, but I'm driving by myself 3/5ths of the way across the country, and I may sleep in rest stops. For me, it's my giant Gerber pigsticker and my little Gerber pocket knife. Stowed in checked baggage, of course.</p><p></p><p>Electronics: I have a Keen shoulder bag that stores most everything I need: laptop, adapters, a tiny MIDI keyboard in case I get inspired to write music. I also keep a powered USB hub that can charge my phone, ClearSpot (for 4G wireless, where I can get it) and my iPad.</p><p></p><p>I'm still debating whether I need to take my actual laptop this trip. If I wasn't driving, I would probably only take the iPad and my phone, but it's not like the laptop takes up much more room.</p><p></p><p>Miscellaneous: When I get to Chicago, I'm stopping at an army/navy surplus store and getting the following:</p><p><ul></p><p><li>A sleeping bag</li></p><p><li>Chemical hand warmers</li></p><p><li>A couple of MREs (Meals Ready to Eat)</li></p><p></ul></p><p>I'm also bringing a paracord bracelet, a pair of touchscreen-friendly gloves, and a warm hat. Sound like overkill? Maybe...but if anything happens, I'm prepared.</p><p></p><p>Even if I get lost and don't have a cell signal, my iPad has a compass and a GPS locator built in, so I can generally find my way. Despite my reputation as a firm urbanite, I spent my early years out in the country, and I know the basics of surviving and finding my way in the wilderness. Not that I plan to be in the wilderness, but....</p><p></p><p>For longer trips, I follow my old buddy <a href=\"http://www.outlier.cc\">Abe Burmeister's</a> travel tips. Abe spent a few years as a nomad in the last decade, and he told me how he managed to live out of his Boblbee backpack for months at a time.</p><p></p><p>Basically, he only traveled with a few items: a couple of pairs of nice pants and a couple of nice shirts and his laptop and cell phone. He didn't stay continually on the move -- he'd be in one town, more or less, for a few weeks at a time -- so when he got there, he'd buy a couple of packs of cheap t-shirts and wear them while he was in town. When he left, he'd donate them to Goodwill. This allowed him to travel with a single carry-on bag, pretty much anywhere in the world, with little difficulty. It's a useful trick.</p><p></p><p>I'm off to pack. See you when I get home.</p>",

            "source": {
                "content": "<p>Irene,</p><p></p><p><strong>1) </strong>I did to my knowledge not receive the letter you mention. Perhaps you shoved it under my door and the scampering neighborhood hooligans took it, or the 80 year old Swiss woman you insist is spraying poison all over the yard and running a methamphetamine laboratory in her parlor. Or the spies you seem to believe are hiding in the bushes.</p><p></p><p>Also, for future reference, shoving a note under someone's door is not a guarantee that they will find it, see it, and certainly not that they will read it.</p><p></p><p><strong>2</strong>) As for the $160 vet bill you presented us with: I called the vet and she told me in no uncertain terms that there was nothing wrong with Erwin and that he certainly wasn't poisoned or sick or \"intoxicated\", as you put it. (I suppose he might have been drunk, but I didn't ask the vet if she'd given him a breathalyzer test. He has never shown a predilection for alcohol, however, as he is a cat.)</p><p></p><p>She also told me that you claimed to be my cat sitter and that I'd authorized you to take him to the vet. Neither of these is true. So you took him to the vet, incurring this bill, without my permission and for no sane reason at all. Your claims that our other neighbor, Pia, was poisoning the animals is as utterly insane and groundless as your claims that she is some sort of meth cook, and suggests to me that you are possibly a paranoid schizophrenic.</p><p></p><p>However, we've paid for half of your fraudulent bill, and will pay the other half at our convenience -- not because we believe we owe it to you, but because we want this matter settled. But that's as far as it goes. Consider yourself lucky that we don't litigate against you. I'm sure there's some legal prohibition upon stealing your neighbor's cat and taking him to the vet because you're a madwoman.</p><p></p><p><strong>3)</strong> As I've told you twice previously, I don't have Erwin's vaccination records, nor do I remember the name of the veterinarian I took him to to get them. There's no legal requirement for me to keep these records. He is a cat, not a human child.</p><p></p><p><strong>4)</strong> I absolutely, categorically refuse to pay for your $1000 doctor's visit. If you hadn't felt the need to fraudulently abduct my cat and take him to the vet without my permission, he wouldn't have scratched you. Nor was he \"intoxicated\", according to the vet who saw him. You are merely demented.</p><p></p><p>Also, my wife has warned you -- in writing -- that you play with our cat at your own risk.</p><p></p><p>If you feel the need to take this matter to court, feel free. I have an excellent attorney and will promptly countersue you for harassment. I suspect the court will find in my favor, as I am not a paranoid lunatic who takes pictures of my neighbors because I believe they are all conspiring against me.</p><p></p><p><strong>5)</strong> For at least two years you have felt the need to take my cat into your home without asking my permission and feed him and generally behave in a terribly creepy fashion. To avoid a confrontation, we've allowed this. That ends now. I demand that you leave my cat, Erwin, alone. Your Erwin privileges are, as of this moment, revoked. Don't feed him, don't allow him into your house, don't touch him. If I see you put food out for him I will throw it away. If I see you picking him up I will take him from you physically.</p><p></p><p>And, God help you, don't harm him, or I will have you prosecuted for animal cruelty. You will go to jail.</p><p></p><p><strong>6) </strong>If you want to pursue this matter, do so through your attorney. My wife and I wish no further contact with you, and if you harass us -- or continue to behave as though our cat is your pet -- I will, again, pursue the matter with the authorities.</p><p></p><p>I understand that you've been evicted from your apartment for basically behaving like a madwoman. I advise you to simply drop this matter and leave. Perhaps your lunacy intimidates others, but you don't frighten me with your maniacal legal threats.</p><p></p><p>Signed,</p><p>Joshua Ellis</p>",

            "source": {
                "content": "<p>Sometime early Monday morning, my old friend and collaborator Tommy Marth committed suicide.</p><p></p><p>What a prick.</p><p></p><p>And Tommy <em>was</em> a prick, make no mistake. It was his chief public characteristic. He was cynical, sarcastic, caustic as industrial solvent. The day he met my wife Rosalie, he walked up and said \"So this is the stupid bitch who's marrying you?\" He was kidding, but one of Tommy's greatest talents was the maintenance at all times of an absolute poker face.</p><p></p><p>I say one of his talents, because Tommy had quite a number of them. Like every member of his family, he was a gifted musician -- in Tommy's case, it was the saxophone. He was most known, in fact, for being the studio and live saxophonist for Las Vegas's biggest music act, The Killers, playing on their records <em>Sam's Town</em> and <em>Day And Age</em>. But he also played with a lot of less-known local acts like Black Camaro, Ryan Pardey's up-and-coming Halloween Town...and me.</p><p></p><p>Tommy was possessed of one of the fiercest, most unrelenting minds I've ever encountered. It would be a mistake to say that Tommy didn't suffer fools gladly; in point of fact, he didn't suffer them at all. He had no patience with stupid people or the mentally lazy, and he didn't bother to hide his contempt, which also contributed to his reputation as a gigantic raging asshole.</p><p></p><p>I met Tommy, I think, sometime in 2000 or possibly 1999, at Cafe Espresso Roma, where I met so many of the people who've become my good friends and family. Back then, Tommy was still modeling and accompanying casino club DJs on saxophone. My first impression was: <em>prick</em>. And he really was. Why not? He was a male model who literally had to fight off starlets like Tara Reid, who once walked up to him when he was playing at a club and stuck her tongue down his throat. He had no reason to be humble.</p><p></p><p>But then, slowly, I got to know him, and I discovered that underneath his abrasive exterior was a thoughtful, restless autodidact who was fiercely loyal and devoted to his friends and protective of his family. Tommy and I were very similar in many ways: avowed atheists, obsessive music lovers and makers (though Tommy was far more talented in this direction than I will ever be), voracious readers; deep romantics masquerading as dismissive cynics. Tommy sneered at the world because it consistently failed to live up to his expectations of what it could be.</p><p></p><p>For a few years there, we were close. I moved in with Tommy's brother, Ryan, and Tommy and I would sit for hours and hours in Ryan's condo, filled with instruments and recording gear and the detritus of a thousand electronic experiments, and watch movies or play <em>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</em> endlessly, disregarding the built-in missions in favor of simply raining chaos down on the cops and whores of Vice City, stealing tanks and using them to demolish entire neighborhoods of the city while \"Fascination\" by the Human League played endlessly on the in-game radio station. (On at least one occasion when we finished a marathon gaming session by heading to nearby all-night bar and restaurant Ichabod's, I nearly had to physically restrain Tommy from ramming a cop car, pulling the cop out, beating him up, stealing his cruiser, and going on a mayhem-filled joyride. It was that kind of game.)</p><p></p><p>We never paid to get into nightclubs or bars; Tommy knew everybody. We would stand back and critique the decor of the place, the layout, the DJ's music choices, the lighting. For Tommy, the glamorous Vegas nightclub wasn't fun, it was a job. He was one of those people who float through the places other people are desperate to get into, shaking hands with the club owner, the promotions manager, the barback, the DJ. Tommy knew <em>everybody</em>.</p><p></p><p>If you knew Tommy, you may have heard him called \"Perfect\" Tommy. That was my nickname for him, taken from a character in <em>Buckaroo Banzai</em>. He was \"Perfect\" Tommy because he <em>was</em> perfect. He was a pretty man who often inspired naked lust in women who encountered him, until they tried playing flirty and ditzy with him and he sent them away with a dismissive remark. (His rebuff to a supermodel who was desperately trying to engage his attention: \"Are you the president of the Ron Perlman Lookalike Club, or just a member?\") He was perfect because he could back his bullshit up, because he was always the coolest guy in the room, whether the room in question was our kitchen or the dancefloor <em>du jour</em>. I even made \"I (Heart) Perfect Tommy\" t-shirts with an online printshop; to our delight and confusion, I sold one to somebody on the far side of the world.</p><p></p><p>We were close, and then we weren't. Tommy was increasingly involved with his music career, and he seemed to spend less time out and about, more time in the studio or just hanging out with Ryan and their sister Melissa. We were close, and then life happened, the way it often does, and instead of hanging out with Tommy every night, I'd see him once a month, then once every few months. He got busy; I got married and quit drinking, which obviated the only two reasons I ever really made the scene. We just weren't moving in the same places anymore. But he was still my friend.</p><p></p><p>When he went on tour with the Killers, we sat around Facebook and giggled at the pictures he sent from far-flung places: Tommy riding a bicycle in Paris looking like some kind of sinister homosexual prostitute in his everpresent (and utterly hetero-challenged) v-neck t-shirt, Tommy at the Acropolis in Athens, Tommy surrounded by adoring groupies backstage at a London show. It was funny to imagine Perfect Tommy hanging out with the bright young things of 2000s indie rock, still sneering, still the coolest guy in the room. (He once spent an evening in the NYC apartment of Strokes lead singer Fab Moretti, discomfiting Moretti's then-girlfriend Drew Barrymore by endlessly giggling at how much she resembled his sister Melissa.)</p><p></p><p>Then he came back, and seemed to resume the path he'd been carving for himself for years: working at the Revolution Lounge and the Royal House and the Beauty Bar, handling nightlife promotion or managing the bar, still recording and playing gigs with friends. Since November, he'd been working as nightlife promotions manager at the Hard Rock Casino.</p><p></p><p>I found out that last part, by the way, by reading his obituary in the <em>Las Vegas Weekly</em>. The last time I really talked to Tommy was at his brother Ryan's birthday party last year. I'd seen a couple of times since then, for brief moments, at the Beat Coffeeshop or outside the Griffin or at the Royal House, but we'd barely done more than hug and promise to catch up.</p><p></p><p>Every so often the last few years I'd call him and text him and email him to come and have coffee or get food, and he simply wouldn't respond. It hurt my feelings, slightly, but Tommy was Tommy. He'd been having other problems as well, which I won't go into here, and I was worried about him. But whenever I'd see him, he always seemed to be doing well, to be happy -- or as happy as Tommy would ever allow himself to appear to be -- to be enjoying himself. He was busy, living the dream, or so I thought.</p><p></p><p>Until yesterday, when my friend Carey Kaplan came into the Coffee Bean, where I was sitting and working on my laptop. (Where I'm sitting and writing this now, in fact.) Her eyes were red.</p><p></p><p>\"How ya doin?\" I asked her. She started to sniffle. \"Not good.\"</p><p></p><p>\"What's the matter?\" I asked. She just looked at me. \"It's bad,\" she said.</p><p></p><p>\"Is it something I need to know?\"</p><p></p><p>\"You'll find out anyway.\"</p><p></p><p>\"Well, what the hell is it?\"</p><p></p><p>And she told me, and I felt the ground drop away from under me.</p><p></p><p>Last night, a few of his people came by my house. We sat on my front lawn in my cheap plastic patio chairs and drank Jameson's and listened to the Pogues and told stories about the silly, mean, amazing shit Tommy had pulled in his brief life.</p><p></p><p>His brother Ryan came over late. We laughed about what a dick move Tommy had pulled. In fact, Ryan and I agreed, we should hang a banner at the entrance to his funeral that just read DICK MOVE in giant letters. I pulled out an old promotional ad I'd made for my erstwhile music store Mperia.com, featuring Tommy and Ryan and our friend Alex and myself as a sort of retarded fake boy band. Ryan was the Sensitive One, Alex the Pretty One; I was the Odd One, the one member of every boy band who seems utterly out of place. Tommy was the Tough One, throwing shapes in a pair of wraparound sunglasses and a Kangol hat.</p><p></p><p>We talked about the surreality of receiving condolence messages via the social networks from Killers fans; I was unaware that, for some time, Tommy helped to manage the Killers' official fan club. It surprised me because it seemed totally at odds with the Perfect Tommy I knew, but many of the fans who messaged me or replied to my posts told me how sweet he was with the Victims, as they were called. (I joked with Ryan and TJ Styles, bassist for Big Friendly and a close family friend, that when I started getting messages about how nice Tommy was to the Victims, my first thought was \"They knew about the victims? I thought Tommy had hid them away better than that.\")</p><p></p><p>Some of our friends seemed horrified by the fan messages, but I thought they were kind and respectful, and I understand them, I think. Tommy meant something to these people as well. Not the same things he meant to us, but he was still someone who had touched them, either through his music or by simply being nice after a gig, and I was grateful for their sympathies.</p><p></p><p>I asked Ryan, as delicately as I could, how they were planning to handle the funerary arrangements, as he and the rest of Tommy's family are Christians and Tommy was a vicious atheist. \"We're gonna do the most religious ceremony we can,\" Ryan laughed. \"Because fuck him.\" I suggested we get a Catholic priest and a Mormon elder and a voodoo <em>houngan</em> and a faith healer, and then get Richard Dawkins to piss on Tommy's grave. It made Ryan laugh, and I was grateful for that.</p><p></p><p>My heart is broken, not just because my great friend is dead, but because his massive dick move has also broken the hearts of his brother and sister, who are two of my favorite people on Earth, and whose sweetness and good-naturedness have always stood in marked contrast to Tommy's cynicism. They do not deserve this, nor do his parents, nor do any of us who cared about him.</p><p></p><p>I don't know why Tommy chose to do this stupid thing, or if it was even something he considered for more time than it took to do it. I'd always known that Tommy was wounded by a world that never lived up to his expectations, but I'd always assumed his colossal ego, arrogance and intelligence would keep him moving, because <em>fuck the lot of you</em>. And I'd always sort of looked forward to seeing old Tommy: old, mellowed out Tommy. He would be calmer, less cruel, less dismissive...but he would still have been the coolest cat in the room.</p><p></p><p>And now we'll never find out.</p><p></p><p>So we're going to bury Tommy soon, and the rest of us are going to go on. He will never get any older, mellow out; his perpetual growth of stubble will never go gray, his bald head will never stoop. He will exist only in the memories of those who loved him, and who will always miss him, and always be furious at this, his last dick move, and I miss him like hell already.</p><p></p><p>Goodbye, brother.</p><p></p><p></p>",

And from a place where Reconstruction didn't end until the 1950s. If you came from people often referred to on campuses as crackers and rednecks or, condescendingly, as blue collar or poor-white Appalachians. If even the uncertain gentility of the South, who accord physical work no dignity at all, refer to your people as peckerwoods - in what tradition do you find an example? That we whaled the piss out of them that first time at Bull Run? That Great-granddaddy did right at Vicksburg, that a corner of Shiloh is forever Yazoo City? There is much honor and more sense in having succeeded with what was left, making something </em></p><p><em>with the damned forty acres and a muddy mule, but you have to be able to see </em></p><p><em>that. No one will tell you.</em><br /></p><p>–Thomas Harris,<br /></p><p><em>Hannibal</em></p><p></p><p>I am increasingly cognizant, these days, of the notion of privilege, and the fact that, as a straight, physically large and intimidating white man, I possess quite a lot of it by default. It's increased particularly since my marriage, oddly, because I am now acutely aware that my lovely and wonderful wife does not exist in the same universe I do.</p><p></p><p>In my universe, a dark and empty street holds no particular fear; as I always jokingly assure her when she tells me to be careful on a late-night walk to the store, <em>I'm</em> the thing to be afraid of in the dark. And it's true. Nobody catcalls at me, or tries to get me to get in their car, or tries to put their hands on me. But people -- <em>men</em> -- do that to her, with a casualness and frequency which I find astonishing.</p><p></p><p>That astonishment may sound naive to you, and maybe it is. But the fact is that men don't do that to her when I'm around. Men don't do that to <em>any</em> women when I'm around. It's not like I'm some kind of white knight; it simply literally <em>does not happen in my presence</em>, presumably because the kind of men who behave this way are the kind of cowards who wouldn't dare harass a woman if there's even the possibility that another man might call them out on it. I live in a world where that horrible shit doesn't exist.</p><p></p><p>And of course, as I've become aware of this, I've become aware of all the other horrible shit that doesn't happen to me; the shit that happens outside the edges of my peripheral vision. Nobody ever follows me suspiciously around a store because of the color of my skin; nobody ever talks to me as if I'm mentally challenged when I go into a bookstore; nobody ever calls me a faggot and threatens to kick my faggot ass (at least not anymore, but that's a whole other story). Nobody ever makes snide half-muttered remarks about how I ought to go back to my own country. Nobody ever tells me that what I need is a big dick in my pussy to turn me straight.</p><p></p><p>I don't even see this happening to other people. Maybe it's just because I'm not mentally prepared to see it when it <em>does</em> happen, or even recognize that it's happening. But I'm a pretty observant person, and by and large I think that it really <em>doesn't</em> happen when I'm around, for the same reason that men don't actively and aggressively harass women in my presence: because the people who are likely to do that sort of thing don't want to take a chance that my big scary ass might step in on the situation. (On the rare occasions that anybody will make a bigoted or homophobic or sexist remark to me or around me, it's usually someone who's obviously chemically altered or just plain stupid, like some douchebag frat boy or a random tweaker on a bus -- people whose sense of self-preservation is at a low.)</p><p></p><p>But there's another facet to the notion of privilege that I have begun to think about and question, one that perhaps comes from the opposite side of that idea: namely, the automatic assumption that straight white people automatically possess infinite privilege, a sort of token Get Out Of Jail Free card that they can throw up whenever they need to. I notice it because I see this idea taken for granted by a lot of people, and it is my experience that it is simply and bluntly untrue.</p><p></p><p>I recently read and was struck by a 2010 piece by Ta-Nehisi Coates entitled \"<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/personal/archive/2010/10/a-culture-of-poverty/64854/\" target=\"_blank\">A Culture Of Poverty</a>\", in which he discusses his own aggressive reaction to a rude, insistent critic, and how it was, at least in part, a product of his own upbringing in rough West Baltimore:</p><p><blockquote>It defies logic to think that any group, in a generationaly entrenched position, would not develop codes and mores for how to survive in that position. African-Americans, themselves, from poor to bourgeois, are the harshest critics of the street mentality. Of course, most white people only pay attention when Bill Cosby or Barack Obama are making that criticism. The problem is that rarely do such critiques ask  why anyone would embrace such values. Moreover, they tend to assume that there's something uniquely \"black\" about those values, and their the embrace.</blockquote></p><p><br /></p><p>He's right, of course: there's nothing \"black\" about the mentality of being willing to whip somebody's ass for getting up in your face and disrespecting your shit. I recognized his reaction immediately -- <em>man, you best step the fuck off</em> -- because it's probably the exact same thing I would have done in the same situation. Because it's <em>not</em> a product of \"black\"; it's a product of <em>poor</em>.</p><p></p><p>We don't talk much about poor white folks in America, these days. In the sort of circles I run in -- liberal, progressive, culturally tolerant and permissive -- poor white trash are the last cultural group who can be stereotyped, lumped together, dismissed and ridiculed without fear of confrontation or social reprisal. We call these people \"rednecks\" and refer to the rural states they occupy as \"flyover\" country; we label them as bigots and small-minded, childish religious fanatics; we shake our heads as they consistently vote against their own best interests, whichever way the neo-conservatives tell them to. We act like they're fools.</p><p></p><p>And we're right, of course. They <em>are</em> fools. But they're only fools in the same way that poor urban blacks are self-defeating fools who perpetuate their own misery indefinitely; in other words, that isn't the whole story or even most of it. And as Coates rightly points out, the question that's never asked is: why would anyone embrace that sort of foolishness?</p><p></p><p>I think I have a rather unique perspective on the issue, owing to my rather eclectic upbringing. It's not worth getting into my whole family history, but the long and short is: sometimes I was well-off, and sometimes I wasn't. At best we were upper middle class; at worst, we were barely clinging to the \"working\" part of the working class.</p><p></p><p>I'm fairly confident in saying that I've been exposed to pretty much every way of life a white guy can be in this country. My grandparents were friends of the Bush family, Texas jet-setters during the oil industry's economic explosion of the 1970s and 1980s; I went to private middle school with kids whose parents were business partners of Ross Perot, kids who had their own small yachts to compliment those of their parents. For my seventh grade school trip, we took a bus from north Texas to Vail, Colorado; it was my first time snowboarding, as I remember.</p><p></p><p>And yet, a few years later, for complicated reasons, my mother and stepfather and I were living in a trailer outside of Hamilton, Montana. My dad was out of work for a couple of months, because the sawmill he worked in had been shut down by Greenpeace activists trying to save the spotted owl. I was expelled from school for mouthing off one too many times to my teachers, so he and I would go and cut down trees for friends in return for a share of the firewood. One winter, we all slept in the living room of the trailer because that's where the wood-burning stove was; every few hours, during the night, one of us would have to get up and spray off the chimney pipe of the stove with a hair spritzer full of water, because it would get red hot and begin to smoulder where it met the roof if we didn't. We slept huddled together, because if we didn't, we would have quite literally frozen to death in the subzero temperatures of the Montana winter night.</p><p></p><p>I don't mention this to make you feel sorry for me; I mention it because I feel like I probably have a pretty good handle on what it's like to be a redneck, to be a flyover person in a flyover state -- to live your life, as Jarvis Cocker says in the classic Pulp song \"Common People\", without meaning or control. But I also see what it's like to be the sort of white person that people refer to when they refer to \"white people problems,\" like not being able to get good wifi so you can download your podcast of <em>This American Life</em>. Ta-Nehisi Coates can tell you that not all black people are the same; I can tell you, with the same absolute assurance, that not all white people are the same, either.</p><p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">*     *     *</p></p><p>So here you are, a teenage girl in the heart of America's heart. You were born in the tiny emergency room of the same small rural town your people have lived in for at least a century. Your parents aren't hardworking salt of the earth farmers or millworkers, the kind of people that get country songs written about them and whom politicians like to hold up as examples of the rugged American can-do spirit. They're white trash. Your mom's an alcoholic who's recently discovered the joys of bathtub crank; God only knows where your daddy is or even <em>who </em>he is. He could really be any one of the fat bastards who prop up the bar down to the Brass Rail six nights a week, when they're not bowling.</p><p></p><p>You live in a trailer with your fifty-five year old grandmother, who insists you call her Mae instead of Granny or Grandma -- \"because, fuck, honey, I ain't <em>that</em> goddamn old\" -- and who works part-time doing nails for the rich bitches who live up the hill, and spends the rest of her time sitting around drinking Southern Comfort out of a tumbler she got with Camel Cash that has a picture of Joe Camel playing pool and smoking a cigarette on it. That's when <em>she's</em> not down at the Brass Rail, drinking Rolling Rock and putting quarters in the jukebox to hear Shania sing \"Man, I Feel Like A Woman\" for the thousandth time and waiting to see which one of the upstanding gentlemen will take her home and fuck her tonight. Hell, it might be the same one who took Momma home back when it was Garth Brooks instead of Daughtry on CMT; nobody knows for sure, and it wouldn't matter if they did.</p><p></p><p>Momma's never had any kind of real job; sometimes she works graveyard down at the Stop 'N' Shop out on the highway, but that's only when they need an extra hand and it's usually only one or two nights a week when they do. Most of the time, your little family subsists on what they tend to call \"government assistance\" around here, because \"welfare\" is for niggers. Your mother will self-righteously tell anybody that she's a stay-at-home mom, but apparently \"stay-at-home\" doesn't include staying at home at night or most weekends.</p><p></p><p>What she <em>does</em> do when she's at home is get into shouting matches with Mae and bitch about those fuckin' skinny bitches on the TV and occasionally sneak into the bathroom to snuffle up some of the shitty crank she gets from one of her boyfriends, who's a nominal biker with a connection out of Bakersfield, California. Any parenting she does is limited to sending you down to the Vons with your food stamps to pick up a loaf of Wonder bread, some generic bologna with the red wrapping on the outside, and a couple of six packs of Diet Shasta, because if you get a fat ass now you ain't never gonna lose it, honey. Since the Vons won't take food stamps for her Camels and her generic vodka, she sends you along with a Ziploc baggie full of quarters for those items.</p><p></p><p>You're not in such great shape yourself. You don't read too good; it's just hard to pay attention in school. Nobody gives a shit if you do good or not, because everybody knows your family are fucking worthless, so they pretty much let you slide; that fuckin' No Child Left Behind bullshit doesn't really apply out here. You think maybe you'd like to go to school to be a fashion designer, but you're not really sure how somebody actually goes and does that. You'll figure it out later. They've diagnosed you with ADD, but you think that's full of shit. Doesn't matter. It's not like Momma can afford to buy the medicine they prescribed you anyway.</p><p></p><p>You've been sneaking your mom's Camels since you were ten, and smoking pot since you were thirteen. Momma doesn't know you dip into her crank a little bit, every so often, when you need a little pick-me-up to drag your ass out of bed and down to the high school. One time, Troy down the road gave you a line of coke in return for sucking his dick at a house party. Fuck, you wish you could afford to do <em>that</em> shit all the time. But you can only think of one way to get the money to have a coke habit, and that's some shit you're not really into.</p><p></p><p>You <em>technically</em> lost your virginity when you were nine, when one of your mom's boyfriends got drunk and came in your bedroom and accidentally fucked you instead of her. Now that you think about it, it's entirely possible that it was actually your father. But that was, like, just some shit that happened; you <em>really</em> lost your virginity when you were eleven, to a twenty-three year old mechanic named Toby you met at a party. You told him you were seventeen; girls in your family always <em>did</em> develop early, and besides, he was so fuckin' drunk you could've told him you were Dolly Parton and he woulda believed it.</p><p></p><p>You \"dated\" Toby  -- meaning you went over to his house and fucked him while <em>Survivor </em>played on his TV in the background -- for three months, until somebody finally told him how old you were and he panicked. Not that he needed to; it's not like Momma or Mae gave much of a shit. They said they liked having him around. Mae always wanted him to sit next to her on the couch when he came over.</p><p></p><p>You heard from Becky's sister that Toby's a total homo now, taking night classes at the community college three towns over. \"Taking dick-sucking classes,\" Becky's sister said, but what the fuck does <em>that</em> bitch know anyway?</p><p></p><p>Last year you were going out with Mike, who's way into hip-hop; he wants to be, like, the next Eminem, except he can't rap for shit. But he was a good boyfriend and he never hit you or left you stranded out in the country or anything like that. He even told you he loved you, and you believed him. You thought maybe you loved him too, and maybe he was the one. But then he cheated on you with that fuckin' whore Lorena and got her pregnant, and she went to live with her cousins in Reno and Mike had to go in the Army. He's in Iraq now, and sometimes he posts pictures of the baby on his Facebook, which you occasionally check at the school library. Lorena's a fat fuckin' goddamn whore and you've sworn you were gonna fuckin' stab her if she showed her fuckin' face around again, but the baby's cute. You want a baby of your own, maybe.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, lying in your single bed in your trailer at night, surrounded by stuffed animals and listening to the wind howl endlessly outside, you dream about a whole other kind of life, somewhere else, like on TV, where people live by the ocean and go and do all that weird shit you can't even imagine. That's the life you want; that's the life you ought to have. When Mae takes you to church on Sundays, that's what you pray to Jesus for: dear Lord our God in Heaven, meek and mild, please please <em>please</em> take me away from here. I wanna be one of the TV people.</p><p></p><p>And sometimes you sit on the curb at the Stop 'N' Shop, drinking a raspberry Icee and smoking a Camel, and you look out at the highway, the way cars just disappear into the dark, and you'd do just about anything to be in one of them, going anywhere, anywhere but here.</p><p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">*     *     *</p></p><p>If that little fictional sketch sounds dramatic to you, then you've never spent any time in small-town America. In point of fact, it's based on specific details of people I knew and went to school with...as well as some people from my own family.</p><p></p><p>Whatever special favors are granted by white privilege in America, they don't particularly apply to my little small-town sweetheart here. She's as trapped by the circumstances of her birth as any African-American kid in South Central or Latino kid in the barrio in Phoenix.</p><p></p><p>I <em>know</em> these people. I came up with them. I saw how few of them escaped the black hole of being a poor white redneck piece of shit in America. I was lucky I had the resources I did; lucky I ended up living in Las Vegas with a good job and a beautiful wife and a great life, instead of working at a dying factory married to some idiot girl I'd knocked up my junior year, with a parcel of dirty children and a whole lot of potential and good intentions washed down the drain.</p><p></p><p>And even when they <em>do</em> get out, their escape velocity doesn't usually take them all that far. For a lot of kids I knew, the Big Show wasn't New York or Los Angeles or Chicago; it was goddamn Billings, Montana or Boulder, Colorado or Ogden, Utah. They're the ones who show up for interviews in the HR office at your company wearing Wal-Mart suits and big clumpy work shoes, the ones whose alma mater is Pinedale Community College, who still put their high school membership in Future Farmers of America on their resumes, who never did an internship and have absolutely no work experience because the only jobs where they come from involve manning a cash register, cutting down trees or cooking meth in a bathtub.</p><p></p><p>When they walk out of the office after their hesitant, doomed interview, you look after them and laugh; you'd never ever think of sneering at a black dude who came for an interview, but you've got no problem going \"Dude, what the fuck was up with Joe Dirt?\" Because he's white, and therefore he's got <em>privilege</em>.</p><p></p><p>Yeah. Cletus the slack-jawed yokel from East Buttfuck Holler, Kentucky might never get racially profiled...but he's fucked just the same. If his chances of success in modern America are any better than the kids Ta-Nehisi Coates came up with in West Ballmer, it ain't by much of a margin.</p><p></p><p>I don't claim to be one of these people. I'll absolutely, readily admit that I had opportunities and chances most of them never even dreamed of; the older I get the more I understand that, and the more thankful I am. But I'm also less inclined to simply dismiss them as stupid fucking rednecks.</p><p></p><p>Are they bigoted, small-minded, racist and homophobic and usually sexist as all hell? Sure. No defending them on that front. But I'm pretty sure Ta-Nahisi Coates would tell you that the easiest way to get your ass whipped in West Baltimore back in the day was to suggest that another gentleman might, in fact, be a homosexual. I'm pretty sure the boys in the hood had some extremely odd ideas about how rich white motherfuckers spent their time too.</p><p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">*     *     *</p></p><p>Here's what I figured out a long time ago: poor white trash and poor black trash have far more in common with each other than they do with wealthier people of their own skin color. We always make it about race in America, when it really has a lot more to do with class than anything else.</p><p></p><p>Part of that is an incredible trick, perpetrated by the wealthy elite in this country in the years after the Civil War, when all of a sudden the poor white stratus of Scots-Irish former indentured servants and fieldhands were joined by the newly freed African-American slaves. It was a pivotal moment in our nation's history, and there was a moment when the paddies and the darkies could've recognized their common situation -- namely, that their indenture and slavery had been replaced by an unspoken <em>de facto</em> economic subjugation by the same privileged landowners who had held the deeds to their lives so recently -- and banded together to level the playing field.</p><p></p><p>But the trick -- that hideous, remarkable bit of probably unconscious legerdemain on the part of America's rich white <em>ubermenschen</em> -- was to whisper into the ear of all those hillbillies. <em>Sure, you're poor, uneducated; you don't have anything and you probably never will. You'll never come sit at our table, Bubba. But you know what? You're still better than a nigger</em>.</p><p></p><p>And that hatred was what those poor motherfuckers held on to...because they didn't have anything else except that toxic measure of their own negligible worth. <em>Still better than a nigger,</em> right? Or some smartass queer in San Fagcisco with his fuckin' Pride parade, running around in a pair of assless leather pants...or some spic motherfucker wants to come up here and steal <em>my</em> job...or some stupid loudmouth bitch whinin' about, <em>oooh</em>, <em>equal rights</em>. I may be ignorant as dirt, I may be mean as a badger stuck down a hole, I may have absolutely not a goddamn thing that ain't on layaway or owned by the bank, but I'm better than all o' them.</p><p></p><p>And so on, for a century and a half. The descendants of those bigoted, hating and self-hating and hated servants fought and died alongside the descendants of those slaves on the beaches of Normandy and Iwo Jima, the foothills of Korea, the jungles of Vietnam and the deserts of Iraq and Afghanistan, partially out of patriotism but mainly because it was a noble way to get the fuck out of the shithole ghettos and the shithole small towns that spawned them. They died for an America that lied to them and told them they were enemies.</p><p></p><p>Can you hate them for their small-mindedness, for their savage insistence that they're God's chosen people on Earth, despite every bit of evidence to the contrary? Of course you can. You can hate a mad dog for trying to bite you. But you're not human if you don't feel pity, too...even though they'll hate you twice as hard for pitying them. They don't want you or need you, and you don't need them. But we all have to live in this country together.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps if we stopped looking at the deceptively simple barrier of race, if we stopped our centuries-old denial that America is a nation where class matters more than perhaps anything else; if we asked Coates's all important question of <em>why</em>, maybe we would be able to find more common ground than we ever thought imaginable. Maybe we'd stop seeing shifty niggers and stupid cracker around every corner, and start looking up the ladder at the real bastards who are fucking all of us, the ones for whom the only color that really matters is green.</p><p></p><p>I know I'll never fully understand how much grace is automatically afforded to me here, simply by virtue of a set of characteristics over which I've had no control. But I've also seen where the limits of that grace lie, and what a pathetic advantage it is in the long run. I was also fortunate in that I not only saw how to escape the trap of poor white trash America, but that I was even capable of understanding that there <em>was</em> a trap in the first place: that white privilege and straight privilege and male privilege, for all they confer upon their possessor, only go so far.</p><p></p><p>It's a lesson much smarter people than me seem to often miss, one I think they desperately need to understand before any real healing can begin in this country; before we can truly find any common ground.</p>",

            "source": {
                "content": "<p>Dear hip music bloggers,<br /><br />Fuck off and die.<br /><br />I can just see all of you, sitting in your little rooms in the weeks since Lana Del Rey's disastrous appearance on *Saturday Night Live*, coming up with the clever little *bon mots* you planned to sprinkle all throughout your review of Del Rey's debut album, *Born To Die*, the day it dropped. How you giggled at your own oh-so-apt metaphors! How proud you were of your complex understanding of the nature of post-modernism and the Society of the Spectale as it related to Del Rey and her public persona! This, you thought, *this* is the review that's finally going to make Pitchfork sit up and notice me!<br /><br />You're pathetic. You're not clever. And none of you know a goddamn thing about music, because *Born To Die* is one of the best pop records I've heard in decades and perhaps in my entire life. If you don't hear that, you don't understand anything about what pop music is. Go back to masturbating every time some member of Animal Collective tries (and fails) to capture the syrupy, wretched exuberance of ELO's playbook. <br /><br />Fuck off and die.<br /><br />We get so caught up now in the deconstruction of music and musicians that a lot of the time, we just forget entirely about what music is and how to judge it. It doesn't matter one single fucking bit whether Lana Del Rey is really Lizzy Grant or Miley Cyrus or the ghost of Nina Simone. It doesn't matter whether she's rich or poor, whether she grew up in a New York penthouse or in a pig wallow in rural Alabama. It doesn't matter if she writes her own songs, or arranges them. It doesn't even really matter if she can perform them live or on TV, because pop music isn't about live performance anyway, it's about how you interact with the music in your car or your living room or the interior of your own head.<br /><br />Pop music is about sex and intoxication and romance and beauty and sleaze and the ways we can transcend our own lives through these things, and by this standard, *Born To Die* is flawless. And make no mistake, not for a second: Lana Del Rey is a pop singer. She's not an indie rocker, she's not avant garde. She's a pop singer like Britney Spears or, God help us, Ke$ha. <br /><br />But unlike these lesser talents, Lana Del Rey obviously *likes* indie rock and alternative and avant garde music. She's absorbed decades of Stereolab and Portishead and Cat Power and Fiona Apple and even Patti Smith, and taken bits and pieces of all of it and made it something that will appeal to the common denominator.<br /><br />People say the same thing about Lady Gaga, but it's not true, because Lady Gaga makes shitty fucking music. Look, you know it and I know it; the only reason anybody gives a shit about her is because she's made her career selling faux controversy to people desperate for it. To paraphrase the film Se7en, just because Gaga rented The Cell on DVD once doesn't make her Joel-Peter fucking Witkin. It's still shite house music no matter how you spin it.<br /><br />Lana Del Rey's music is gorgeous. (And it doesn't matter if we mean Lana Del Rey the girl, or Lana Del Rey the public face of a songwriting/production team, or anything else. Stop being boring and pay attention.) It's a blend of Peggy Lee and Missy Elliot and Angelo Badalamenti, hip-hop beats filtered through the noir side of every bit of American pop since Pat Boone's \"Moody River\". It's lush and intoxicating, like the smell of Chanel No. 5 and Marlboros. It's drawing from everywhere, Bjork and Blue Velvet. The best thing about Lana Del Rey is that her influences are impeccable.<br /><br />You know what? I was going to write a real review of this record, but I'm not going to, because I don't want to convince you that it's amazing. You'll buy it or you won't; you'll like it or you won't. In fact, I hope you don't like it, because then it'll still be my little secret, someone else's music that belongs to me the way music used to belong to people before the relentless light of the Net was shined into every dark corner, before every useless snarky fuck with a Tumblr decided it was their personal job to either create or destroy artists, whilst never having the fucking guts or the soul to make art themselves.<br /><br />Fuck you if you don't like *Born To Die*, and fuck you if you do. Either way, it's mine, and I love it, and that's all that matters.</p>",

I wish he hadn't done it in the first place, of course; I wish I could have talked to the guy. I wish I could have told him that there's very little you can do at the age of 22 that's not undoable, short of killing someone or having a kid; no matter how bleak your situation seems, you can always change it. More than that, though, I wish I could have told him: <em>dude, it's just a fucking social network. It doesn't matter.</em></p><p></p><p>I think a lot of us lose perspective working in this industry. There's a lot of hyperbolic and impossibly hypocritical rhetoric thrown around by tech founders and venture capitalists. The words \"world-changing\" and \"revolutionary\" get thrown around a lot, and it's mostly at projects and products that don't deserve these adjectives.</p><p></p><p>Diaspora had and has absolutely no chance at \"changing the world\". It's another social network, just like the ones that came before it and have now vanished into the ether. By and large, social networks are not changing and will not change the world, any more than message boards did before them. They'll be the default exciting way that people interact online for a few years, then somebody will come up with some permutation that's different enough to warrant another generalized term -- \"social whiteboard\" or some other such ill-fitting metaphor -- and Facebook and Diaspora and all their predecessors will be just part of the early history of the global network. This new world of ours is nothing if not ephemeral.</p><p></p><p>Most of the \"revolutions\" we generate in this industry are really just incremental improvements on communications technology...and most of the worldchanging we want to do involves the part of the world that is our own bank balance.</p><p></p><p>What's really sad though -- assuming that Ilya killed himself because he believed his project was a failure -- is that <em>failure is not the end of the world</em>. Hell, it's not even failure, as long as you understand that every new technology or idea is just something you throw at the fucking wall to see if it sticks.</p><p></p><p>I've been involved with two failed startups so far. Both of them were excellent ideas -- because, after all, that's all a startup really is: an idea. One of them never even got publicly announced, because the logistics required to solve the problem it was attempting to solve were simply too expensive and complex to achieve. The other one was probably eight years ahead of its time.</p><p></p><p>It sucked when they tanked. But you know what you learn, when you don't kill yourself at 22 because your idea isn't getting enough attention and it looks like you might not be the visionary you thought you were? You learn that failure is inevitable. And you learn that you simply brush yourself off, go \"Oh, okay, that didn't work,\" and look to see what collateral you can salvage out of the thing that didn't work. Sometimes you'll find you've invented a new technology that might be useful in totally different ways than you originally considered; sometimes you'll find you learned a new skill; more often than not, you'll simply walk away with more experience about how the world works, and how it doesn't.</p><p></p><p>I'm building <a href=\"http://www.stikki.me\" target=\"_blank\">my own little sandbox</a> on the Internet right now, and I'm old enough and wise enough not to have any illusions about its potential to change the world or make me a millionaire. I know the odds are against it...the way they are against any startup. If it fails? That sucks, and I'm going to do everything to keep it from happening, but if it does, I'll just move on to the next idea. I'm never short of ideas.</p><p></p><p>And I struggle with depression every day. Every day that investors fail to materialize, every day that passes that nobody uses this cool thing I've built, I feel like the world is ending, like I should just fling myself under a bus and get it over with. But you know what? The world's not ending. It's just the Internet. It doesn't matter.</p><p></p><p>It's a tragedy when anyone who is not terminally ill commits suicide, and it's even worse when they have their whole lives ahead of them; and maybe there was other stuff going on with Ilya Zhitomirskiy that is not public (and nobody's business, of course). But if the guy really did it because his stupid fucking social network wasn't becoming the coolest thing since Cheez-Whiz, that's even worse, because it means he did it for really no reason at all. It was a meaningless act by someone who lacked the life perspective to understand how absolutely trivial the success or failure of his project was.</p><p></p><p>If you're one of us -- people like me and Ilya Zhitomirskiy, who make up ideas for a living -- never forget that. Never forget that there's always tomorrow, always another idea, always something new and great to do. Don't believe the hype, yours or anyone else's. Fight another day.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

                "content": "<p>As many of you who are regular readers know, I was kind of <a href=\"http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/004498.html\">an early innovator in the realm of crowdfunding</a>. I also regularly <a href=\"http://redstatesoundsystem.bandcamp.com\">record and release my own music</a>, which doesn't make me a lot of money, but enough to occasionally pay for groceries and that sort of thing. As you probably also know, I'm in the middle of starting what I think is an exciting new Web tool, <a href=\"http://www.stikki.me\">Stikki</a>. Things are moving along for Stikki, slowly but surely...but it's the slowly part I wanted to talk to you about today.</p><p></p><p>Here's the long and short of it: a couple of days ago, our car died. We haven't had it towed to a mechanic, but I'm 90% certain that the problem is that the transmission is kaput -- specifically, the torque converter. (The car won't shift out of first gear. It's not grinding, just chugging, and that's basically a sign that the TC is cooked.)</p><p></p><p>This isn't much of a problem for <em>me</em>, as I work out of my house or the local coffee shops...but it's a very big problem for Rosalie, who just started a new job on the other side of town. Las Vegas is a southwestern city, which means it's a sprawl city, so her bus ride would be an hour or more, and our public transportation is both unreliable and franklydangerous for a single young woman. (Almost every dodgy situation I've found myself in since I moved to Vegas has occurred while waiting for a bus, and I'm a big scary dude.)</p><p></p><p>So we need to buy a new car or replace the transmission in ours, which will basically be about the same amount -- $2500 or so. (If we buy an older car, I can do the repair and upkeep myself; I'm not a motorhead, but I know what a Chilton's manual is and I've done basic repair work on my own vehicles before.) But at the moment, it seems unlikely that we'll have that kind of spare money any time soon. (I've got one possible project that would handle essentially all of our money problems, but that's a whole other story. Let's just say I'm not holding my breath.)</p><p></p><p>Many of you have been willing, in the past, to pay actual cash money for my writing or my music. So here's what I'd like to throw out here: what can I offer you that you'd be willing to pay a dollar or two for? More music? Fiction? Non-fiction? Some kind of web app? Something that, even if you yourself couldn't afford to pay for, you'd be willing to share with the world.</p><p></p><p>I actually want to do something that's crowdcommissioned, that's what people want to see, rather than something I come up with myself. It's an interesting challenge, and knowing you maniacs I'm curious as to what you'd come up with.</p><p></p><p>So what do you think? <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/jzellis/\">Tweet at me</a> or write in the comments here.</p>",

She was eleven going on twelve, and I was fourteen, almost grown up; I wouldn’t have ever talked to her except she lived down the road, and she was bossy, always putting her hands on her hips and yelling at me for getting up to dickens, like she was my momma or my boss or something. Like she was doing now. She pushed her glasses up her nose. They were too big for her, and made her look like a little blonde owl.</p><p></p><p>I finished up and looked at her. “I heard you,” I said. I decided to humor her. “What did it look like?”</p><p></p><p>She shrugged. “Like one a them out of your book,” she said. I winced. Right before Halloween I’d taken one of Daddy’s books out of his library and shown it to her, to scare her, like. Her momma’d come to the house and had a talk with Daddy, said Betsy’d been pissing the bed.</p><p></p><p>I thought he was gonna whip the hell out of me, but he just sat me down and told me I couldn’t ever tell nobody about the library, or any of the old family stuff. “People wouldn’t understand,” he said. “Wasn’t too long ago they was burning folks up North for being witches.”</p><p></p><p>“We ain’t witches,” I said, and he laughed. “I know that, boy,” he said, “but most folk can’t tell no difference. They wouldn’t understand, like me being friends with Jim Cowan.”</p><p></p><p>I thought it was over after that, but now here was little Betsy pushing up her owl glasses and standing in my dooryard talking about demons. Momma told me once that some mistakes you keep paying for long after you think you ought to be done paying, and I guessed this was the sort of thing she was talking about.</p><p></p><p>I looked up to the house, nervously. Daddy was inside with his best friend, Mr. Cowan, listening to the President on the radio talking about something he called a “New Deal”. I could hear Daddy laughing in there, but it didn’t sound like he thought it was funny.</p><p></p><p>“New Deal my ass,” he said to Mr. Cowan. “Ain’t never been no new deal for the working man. Always been the same Old Deal.”</p><p></p><p>“Shit,” Mr. Cowan said, only it was more like <em>sheeeeit</em>. “At least y’all got an old deal. Us niggers ain’t never had no kind of deal at all.” My daddy cracked up hard at that, and then Mr. Cowan started laughing too.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Cowan taught down at the Negro school on the other side of town. I think he was their only teacher. Daddy said he was a king hell piano player too; he played at church Sunday night, but Fridays and Saturdays he’d go down to the roadhouse down by the highway and play all night. I asked Daddy once  if we could go see him, if he was so good, but Daddy said no. I asked him if he was ashamed to be seen with a nigger, and that was the only time he ever laid a hand on me. He slapped me hard across the face, but a second later his face was all sad. I was more shocked than anything.</p><p></p><p>“I’m sorry, boy,” he said. “I didn’t mean to do that. But I don’t ever wanna hear you call anybody that, you hear? It ain’t right. Mr. Cowan’s as good as you or me, and maybe better than me, come to think of it.”</p><p></p><p>“Then why can’t we go down and hear him play?” I asked.</p><p></p><p>Daddy smiled, but it was all tight on his face. “Because <em>you</em> know and <em>I</em> know there ain’t nothing wrong with it,” he said, “but if somebody like them McCormicks saw us, they’d cause trouble.”</p><p></p><p>“Trouble for us?” I asked him. He nodded. “For us, but more for Jim,” he said. “And I ain’t gonna bring that down on nobody if I ain’t got no reason to.”</p><p></p><p>I could hear the clink of beer bottles inside, which was good; it meant nobody was paying attention to what I was doing…and nobody was gonna hear Betsy babblin’ about demons.</p><p></p><p>“Ain’t no damn demon in my barn,” I said to her. “Now run on home.” Her eyes opened wide; behind those glasses of hers, it looked like two moons rising. “There is <em>too</em> a demon,” she said, “and I’m gonna tell your momma you was swearin’.” She made like she was gonna run up to my porch, and I ran forward to intercept her.</p><p></p><p>“Alright, shut up,” I said. “Ain’t you a baby?”</p><p></p><p>“Come and <em>see</em>,” she said, and she actually grabbed my hand and started dragging me along. So I went and saw.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">*   *   *</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The barn was older than our house; it was already there when my great-granddaddy bought our land right after the War ended -- the Union War, not the one Daddy fought in over in Europe. I think the barn was why he bought the land; it was weird looking, not a normal big square barn but in this strange shape. It had five sides, or maybe six, I could never keep in my head which: it seemed like every time I counted it was different, but I wasn’t sure. It was made out of some kind of weird wood that was nearly black and looked like some kind of stone, and it didn’t hold a coat of paint worth a damn. Daddy had tried to paint it red a couple of times -- he called it “protective camouflage” -- but every time he did, he’d come out the next day and all the paint would be puddled up on the ground like it had dripped off during the night. After a while he’d stopped trying. He seemed to think it was funny. But he never kept the animals in it at all -- he built a whole pen for the pigs and the cows that was all the way on the other side of the house from the barn, which was about a quarter-mile down a trail from our yard. It didn’t make any sense to me.</p><p></p><p>It was just starting to get dark around that time, and the barn cast a long shadow across the fields. It made me feel weird, like I didn’t want to walk inside it…but I could see, even in the dim light, that the big double doors were open. Not all the way, but more open than they ought to be.</p><p></p><p>“Were you playing in there?” I asked Betsy. “Goddamnit, girl, don’t be doing that. My daddy’ll tan your hide and mine too if he catches you in there. It’s dangerous.”</p><p></p><p>But she was shaking her head, and didn’t even call me out for cussing. “I was just walkin’ by,” she said, “and them doors came open, and I heard somebody inside. They was calling my name. I thought it might be your daddy, so I went and poked my head in.”</p><p></p><p>“And what did you see?”</p><p></p><p>“Something <em>real bad</em>,” she said, and took my hand again.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like it was twenty degrees colder in the shadow of the barn, but I put my big boy face on and went to the doors. Betsy stood twenty feet away, looking like she was going to run. I peeked my head inside.</p><p></p><p>The demon was sitting in the middle of the pile of hay at the far side of the barn. It looked kind of like somebody had taken a man and skinned him up for meat, but there was other stuff done to it too, like some kind of scientist had been doing an experiment. It was rubbing its pecker, but kinda bored like.</p><p></p><p>It grinned when it saw me.</p><p></p><p>You’d think I would’ve screamed and run away then, but I didn’t. I hadn’t ever seen anything like that demon before, but I’d seen plenty of other peculiar stuff. You couldn’t help it, being part of my family.</p><p></p><p>I tensed up, ready to grab Betsy and run if it moved, but it didn’t do anything, just looked at me and grinned and stroked that big old hog-leg it had.</p><p></p><p>“What you want?” I called to it, trying to sound tough. I didn’t feel tough.</p><p></p><p>It didn’t say anything.</p><p></p><p>“You ain’t got no business here,” I told it, “and you better get the hell out of here before I call my Daddy. He’ll come down here and kick your ass for you.”</p><p></p><p>It smiled even wider. “By a strange coincidence,” it said, “your <em>daddy</em> is exactly who I want to see.” It sounded like one of them rich people from up North who pretend like they’re from England when they talk, but when it said <em>daddy</em> its voice went into a deep drawl, like it was making fun of me.</p><p></p><p>“Then why the hell you hidin’ out in the barn?” I asked it. “He doesn’t ever come down here. Ain’t even no cows in here.”</p><p></p><p>“I cannot traverse the boundaries of the circle,” it said.</p><p></p><p>I frowned. “You mean the barn?” I said. “Barn’s ain’t no circle. It has fi--six--a bunch of sides on it. What are you, a dummy?”</p><p></p><p>“Bravado,” it said. “Perhaps I’ll rape you before I eat you, so you learn something. The term ‘circle’ is symbolic. Go get your father.”</p><p></p><p>“Oh, I’ll go get him,” I said, “and he’s gonna come back here and whip the shit out of you. I might help him.”</p><p></p><p>“We’ll see,” the demon said. “Go now. I’m almost finished here,” and it started jerking itself harder.</p><p></p><p>I wrenched up my face in disgust and closed the door. Betsy stared at me.</p><p></p><p>“You was talking to it?” she whispered. “What’d it say?”</p><p></p><p>“Nothing,” I told her. “I got to go get my Daddy.” I hunkered down a bit, so my face was in front of hers. “Listen, Betsy,” I said, “you gotta swear to me you ain’t gonna tell nobody about this. Not even your momma or your daddy, okay?”</p><p></p><p>She whimpered, like a puppy. There were tears dripping down off her glasses. “It talked to me, too,” she said. “It said bad stuff. Dirty stuff. I was scared.”</p><p></p><p>I put my arms around her. “Don’t you worry,” I said, “it can’t come out of there.”</p><p></p><p>“Why not?”</p><p></p><p>I shrugged. “I dunno. But it can’t. And I’m gonna fix this. You believe that?”</p><p></p><p>She nodded and sniffed, but she didn’t look sure. I tousled her head.</p><p></p><p>“It’s alright,” I said. “You just run along home, now.”</p><p></p><p>“Where you goin?” she asked me. I smiled at her.</p><p></p><p>“I’m gonna go get my Daddy,” I said.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">*   *   *</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>“Boy, are you having fun with me?”</p><p></p><p>“No, Daddy,” I said. He and Mr. Cowan sat at the Formica kitchen table, both of them eyeing me like I was a prize turkey. “I swear to God, it’s true. That’s what it…he…said. Said to come get you.”</p><p></p><p>Daddy looked at Mr. Cowan. “Whatcha reckon, Jim?” he said.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Cowan rubbed his middle finger on his forehead, which I’d noticed he always did when anybody asked him something he had to think about. “It doesn’t sound like nothing I’m familiar with,” he said. “Nothing Christian. Maybe hermetic?”</p><p></p><p>Daddy seemed to think about it. “Could be,” he said.</p><p></p><p>“But why the hell is it in your damn barn?” Mr. Cowan said. “You been doin anything out there?”</p><p></p><p>Daddy leaned back in his chair and half-smiled. “What do you mean, exactly, by ‘doin anything’?” he asked.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Cowan gave him the same look, I figured, that he gave kids in his class who were getting sassy. “You know exactly what the hell I mean, Darius Harkness,” he said, “and don’t you go bein all coy on me. This shit is serious.”</p><p></p><p>Daddy sighed. “Alright,” he said. “<em>Maybe</em> I was going through the <em>Libris Infernium</em>. <em>Maybe</em> I was trying out some stuff. Nothing big.”</p><p></p><p>“Big enough,” said Mr. Cowan. “You summoned this, this whatever-the-hell-it-is, and it got pulled into the nearest circle of protection. Which, in <em>this</em> county, is that ugly goddamn barn of yours.”</p><p></p><p>He and Daddy looked at one another for a long minute, their faces stony and serious. Then they both started laughing, fit to beat the band. Daddy was howling and gasping for breath, so hard he slid off his chair and onto the floor.</p><p></p><p>“Oh, what the hell you two up to?” Momma called from the basement. She was down there putting up cans in the pickle cellar. She came up the stairs, wiping the dust off her hands onto her apron. Momma was nearly as tall as Daddy; he said it was because she was a big ol’ Nordic frost giant by way of Fort Worth, Texas, and she said he ought to know better than to say a woman was a big ol’ <em>anything</em>. She came into the kitchen and stood towering over him, and put her hands on her hips, the way little Betsy did.</p><p></p><p>“Well, honey,” Daddy said, still chuckling, “looks like I got some uninvited company up to the barn.” He looked at Mr. Cowan, and then they were both off again, Mr. Cowan’s big white teeth shining in his brown face as he slapped the table with his hand.</p><p></p><p>Momma groaned. “Goddamnit,” she said. She leaned over and whacked Daddy on his head and shoulders with her palm. He just kept laughing. “You ain’t got the sense God gave a gopher, Darius Harkness,” she said. “You ever think about what could happen to your family, you pulling this foolishness? You ever think about that?”</p><p></p><p>“Aw, hell, honey,” Daddy said, trying to pull himself to his feet. “It’s stuck in the damn barn. It can’t even walk through the doors.”</p><p></p><p>“But <em>he</em> can,” Momma said, pointing at me. “You ever think about what woulda happened if he’d gone playing down there?”</p><p></p><p>“Aw, Momma,” I said, “I don’t play no more.”</p><p></p><p>“You keep your trap shut,” she said to me, her lips tight, her eyes squinted down to slits. She turned back to Daddy. “If anything had happened to him--”</p><p></p><p>“Nothing happened, baby, and nothing ever <em>would</em>. He ain’t stupid. He knows better than to go fucking around in that barn--”</p><p></p><p>“Don’t you curse in front of the boy, Darius,” Momma said, and whacked him again, but this only had the effect of getting him laughing all over again. “The two of you better quit braying like a couple of goddamn donkeys and go down there and take care of this, you hear me? I ain’t kidding with you. <em>Now</em>, you hear me? <em>Right now.</em>”</p><p></p><p>“Y-yes, mother,” Daddy said, trying to contain his laughter. “Better see what we got in the library,” he said, and he and Mr. Cowan went into the library.</p><p></p><p>You wouldn’t expect, looking at our house from the outside, that it contained an actual library; we weren’t rich folk by any means, and even though Momma worked real hard to keep the place clean and looking respectable, the fact was that we lived in a broken-down old farmhouse with windows that didn’t close all the way and floorboards that you could see through into the basement, if you laid down on em and peeked your eye through.</p><p></p><p>I’d never quite figured out exactly how we <em>did</em> have a library, really. I’d walked around outside and looked at the house, and then walked inside and looked into the library, which was a largish room with a high ceiling, and I couldn’t exactly understand where it actually <em>went</em>, within the walls. It didn’t have any windows, which was weird, since it was -- I was pretty sure -- on the outside of the house. It just had shelves on every wall, nearly to the ceiling, and in the middle a table made of thick old oak planks that looked like something out of one of Daddy’s old pulp books about pirates. I wasn’t allowed in the library when Daddy wasn’t in it; Momma wouldn’t go in there at all, not even to clean things, though it never seemed dirty.</p><p></p><p>But sometimes I’d sneak in by myself when Daddy was in town or away on business -- like the time I took that book to show Betsy -- and whenever I did, I always had this weird feeling like I wasn’t really still in the house at all, or even Callum County -- like I was in some kind of other place completely. Like I went in there once in the middle of July, and the whole time I was in there I could hear the wind howling outside like there was some kind of blizzard out there.</p><p></p><p>At least, I <em>think</em> it was the wind.</p><p></p><p>Daddy threw the doors open and went inside with Mr. Cowan, and I followed them. Daddy went to the shelf to the left of the door and started walking sideways like a crab, hunched down, running his finger across the spines of the books as he went.</p><p></p><p>“Dee and Kelly?” he said to Mr. Cowan, who was looking at the books on the <em>right</em> side of the door. Mr. Cowan laughed. “Them old frauds?” he said. “Not for this.”</p><p></p><p>Daddy kept looking, occasionally pulling a book from the shelves and tucking it under his arm. When he had five or six of them, he took them to the big table and plonked them down. Mr. Cowan brought a couple of his own books over, and they started poring over them.</p><p></p><p>This got real boring after a while, so I started wandering around, looking at the books myself. Most of them didn’t even seem to be in English. I wished I spoke Latin, but we weren’t Catholics or anything. (We didn’t go to church at all, actually, and when I asked Daddy what kind of people we were if we weren’t Catholics or Baptists or Lutherans, he laughed and told me he guessed we were Democrats.) If we <em>had</em> been Catholics, I might have been able to tell you what <em>De Vermis Mysteriis</em> was. The Mysterious Vermin, I guessed.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Daddy called me over. “Was this what you saw, boy?” he asked me, and held up a big book whose pages were yellowed with age. There was a woodcut in it, and I peered at it.</p><p></p><p>“I think so,” I said. “Only he ain’t got his pecker out in this one.”</p><p></p><p>Daddy and Mr. Cowan looked at each other, and Mr. Cowan whistled. “Sheeeit, boy,” he said to Daddy. “Looks like you hooked yourself one big goddamn catfish.”</p><p></p><p>Daddy closed the book and put it back on the pile. “Well, I guess we better go throw his ass back in the river. You got your shotgun?”</p><p></p><p>“I wanna go with you!” I said.</p><p></p><p>“Absolutely not,” Daddy said. “Your mother’d skin me and hang my hide on the wall for company to look at.”</p><p></p><p>“Aw, Daddy, come on, please?” I said. “How am I supposed to learn nothin if you won’t let me watch?”</p><p></p><p>“I don’t think your momma <em>wants</em> you learnin nothin,” Daddy said, but he looked at Mr. Cowan, who shrugged. “It ain’t really like the boy got much choice in the matter, is it?” he said. “Might as well start now, when you still got an eye on him, than later, when you don’t.”</p><p></p><p>Daddy looked at him, then back at me, for a long minute. Finally he nodded. “Alright,” he said, “but don’t let your momma see.”</p><p></p><p>He and Mr. Cowan swept out of the room, and I followed them. I realized nobody’d put the books back on the shelves, and I opened my mouth to say something, but then I heard a noise behind me.</p><p></p><p>When I turned around, the table was empty. I guess somebody put the books away.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">*   *   *</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>It was full dark by then, and Daddy grabbed his Ray-O-Vac flashlight and his shotgun from out of the hall closet. Mr. Cowan had an electric lantern, and he picked up the machete Daddy used to cut the weeds in the fall.</p><p></p><p>My heart dropped about a hundred feet when we got outside and Momma was standing in the dooryard, but then I realized she’d taken off her apron and her sun dress and put on the overalls she kept for gardening, and tied up her hair with a length of rawhide. And she had Daddy’s Sears &amp; Roebuck axe in her hand, which she was swinging around a little, like she was testing the heft of it.</p><p></p><p>“Hell you think you’re doing?” Daddy asked her.</p><p></p><p>“You think I’m letting you two idiots take my only boy down there without me, you must be drunk or stupid,” Momma said.</p><p></p><p>They stared at each other.</p><p></p><p>“God<em>damn</em>, that’s why I love you, woman,” Daddy said with a grin, and started off down the path to the barn. After a second, Mr. Cowan shook his head and followed. I looked at Momma, and flicked her hand at me.</p><p></p><p>“Well?” she said. “You’re the big demon hunter now, boy, get your ass moving.”</p><p></p><p>She followed me and I followed them, and five minutes later we were at the barn.</p><p></p><p>Even from outside, that demon sounded as pissed off as a prize bull with his nuts cut off. We could hear him banging around inside and throwing things around. Occasionally he’d let out this sound like a pig getting its throat cut. And he kept shouting something. It took me a second to recognize the sound of my own name.</p><p></p><p>“<em>Harknesssssss</em>!” it shrieked.</p><p></p><p>“God in Heaven,” Mr. Cowan said.</p><p></p><p>“For your sake, I damn sure hope so,” said Daddy, and he opened the barn doors.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he did it was silent, like somebody’d shut the door of a madhouse. I stood behind Daddy and Mr. Cowan and peered over their shoulders.</p><p></p><p>The demon was sitting in the middle of the barn’s floor with its legs crossed, like an Indian swami. It looked up, and I thought it was still grinning until Daddy put his flashlight on its face and I realized it hadn’t ever been grinning at all. It just didn’t have any lips.</p><p></p><p>“Harkness,” it said. “Harkness, your mother sucks cocks in Hell, Harknesssssssss.”</p><p></p><p>“Probably,” Daddy said. “She sure sucked enough of them on Earth, way I heard it.” Momma slapped him on his back from behind. “That ain’t no way to talk about your momma,” she said.</p><p></p><p>“How <em>dare</em> you?” the demon said. “How dare you summon me, like I was your dog? Do you know who I am?”</p><p></p><p>“I got a fair idea,” Daddy said. “I ain’t impressed.”</p><p></p><p>“You will be,” the demon said, licking the cauterized wounds around its mouth. “When I peel off your son’s face and use it as a condom while I sodomize your wife, you’ll be quite impressed, I think.”</p><p></p><p>“You hear the mouth on him?” Daddy said to Mr. Cowan. “Perverted sonofabitch, ain’t he?”</p><p></p><p>“Just do it,” Mr. Cowan said, “and quit fucking around.”</p><p></p><p>“Oh, alright,” Daddy said. “<em>Priinceps gloriosissime cælestis militiæ</em>--”</p><p></p><p>The demon reached a hand back between its legs, grunted, shit into its palm, and flung it at Daddy, who took it right across the face.</p><p></p><p>“You think you can dismiss me with that children’s nursery rhyme?” the demon said, sneering. “And I thought the Harkness family was possessed of <em>power</em>. How sweet it will be, when I drag your violated carcass down the road of razors that leads to the gates of Pandemonium, when I hang your head from a spike made from the penis of a blue whale for all to see, when I--”</p><p></p><p>“Enough, already, you’re giving me a goddamn headache,” said Daddy. He raised his shotgun.</p><p></p><p>“Oh, shit, cover your ears, baby,” Momma said, and she and I both did. Mr. Cowan winced and turned away.</p><p></p><p>Daddy pulled the trigger and half the demon’s head went spraying onto the wall of the barn. It stood there for a moment, its remaining eye wide in shock, and then it slowly spiraled and slid to the floor.</p><p></p><p>“Whew,” Daddy said. “It’s alright now.” He stepped into the barn and, after a moment, the rest of us followed him. We looked down at the dying creature, coughing blood all over its own face, or what remained of it.</p><p></p><p>“How…how did you…” it sputtered.</p><p></p><p>“You’re a plain goddamn fool,” Daddy said. “I invoked you into the material world. That makes you material too. What are you, stupid?”</p><p></p><p>“I <em>told</em> you my daddy was gonna whip your ass,” I said to the demon. “You shoulda listened to me.”</p><p></p><p>The demon looked up at me, into my face, and its eye focused on me. Its lips pulled back, and this time I could tell it was smiling.</p><p></p><p>“Guadalcanal,” it said. “Christmas. A bayonet in the throat. The last thing you’ll think of is Betsy and the baby.”</p><p></p><p>And then it fell back, and it was limp. A smell came up off of it like burnt sugar.</p><p></p><p>I looked at Daddy. “What the hell was it talking about?” I asked him. “Guadalupe? Was that what it said?”</p><p></p><p>He looked past me at Mr. Cowan, who shook his head just the tiniest bit, his eyes wide. Then he smiled and ruffled my hair.</p><p></p><p>“Nothing,” he said. “Not a goddamn thing. Let’s go get the shovels, Jim. I think there’s a hole needs digging, out back.”</p><p></p><p>“I’ll go make supper,” said Momma, but she had a strange cast to her eyes when she looked at me. “Why don’t you come back on up to the house and help me shell some peas. Maybe you…maybe you wanna invite that Betsy to come eat with us.”</p><p></p><p>“Sure, I guess,” I said. “She’s a pain, though. If it wasn’t for her we wouldn’t have gotten in this mess in the first place. And didn’t that nasty old thing say something about her anyway?”</p><p></p><p>“Did it?” Daddy said, staring at the shotgun as he ejected the spent shells and peered down the barrels. “I really didn’t notice.”</p><p></p><p>“You run along,” Momma said. “Be back in a half hour.”</p><p></p><p>“Yes, ma’am,” I said. “See you later, Mr. Cowan.”</p><p></p><p>“I’ll--I’ll see you, boy,” Mr. Cowan said, but he didn’t turn around.</p><p></p><p>I ran out of the barn and back towards the road that led to Betsy’s house. I felt strangely proud, even though I hadn’t really done anything. For the first time, I felt like I was beginning to understand who I was, and what my place was in the universe.</p><p></p><p>I had my whole life ahead of me.</p>",

            "source": {
                "content": "<p>I have a problem with Coldplay.</p><p></p><p>It's not that they suck; they really don't suck. They're clearly talented musicians, and Chris Martin -- as he proved all those centuries ago with \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MwjX4dG72s\" target=\"_blank\">Yellow</a>\" -- is clearly a talented singer.</p><p></p><p>What bothers me is not that Coldplay sucks, but that their records suck. I don't understand why or how this happens. They've clearly got the skills to make really good records, and they've got <a title=\"Eno is god.\" href=\"http://www.furious.com/perfect/bangseno.html\" target=\"_blank\">Brian Eno</a> producing them on this new one <em>Mylo Xyloto</em> and the last one, which I think was called <em>A Perfectly Lovely Dinner Party With Friends</em> or something similar. Eno is not known for producing crappy music. In point of fact, he's known for goading relatively uninteresting bands (or rather <em>band</em>, or rather U2) into creating really good work. (For a comparison, look at the records U2 put out without Eno, which -- aside from <em>Boy</em> and <em>War -- </em>have <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Dismantle_an_Atomic_Bomb\" target=\"_blank\">all the charisma of an accounting seminar</a>.)</p><p></p><p>So why in the name of Hell's garbage truck is <em>Mylo Xyloto</em> so goddamn dull?</p><p></p><p>I have Coldplay on my iPod. I do. I'm comfortable enough with my sexuality to admit that, despite a decade of \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuG1vyQ1mUQ\" target=\"_blank\">You know how I know you're gay</a>, etc.\" jokes about the band. Yes, they're big ol' pussies. And that's <em>okay</em>. I find it amusing that people will crack endless jokes about Coldplay and yet have an artist like Bon Iver in constant rotation. I mean, <a href=\"http://www.thepointofeverything.com/2011/06/15/bon-iver-calgary-video/\" target=\"_blank\">Bon Iver is a giant pussy</a>. Bon Iver makes Dan Fogelberg look like G.G. Allin. It's music for girls with asymmetric haircuts to cry to when their boyfriend Tyler leaves them for his coke dealer, who is a dude. Apparently it's okay to be a big pussy if you're an American with <a href=\"http://www.lyricsbird.com/artist/gallery/BonIver/BonIver_11394.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">a Grizzly Adams beard</a> who records your albums in, I dunno, a fucking cabin in the middle of the Michigan forest or whatever the hell these kids think is \"authentic\". But it's not okay, it seems, if you're a metrosexual Englishman permanently wrapped in Ben Sherman high streetwear whose family consists of a decreasingly famous actress and a child named after a computer company.</p><p></p><p>The Coldplay I have on my iPod consists of their previous album, which is actually called <em>Viva La Vida (Death And All His Friends)</em> (which we'll get to in a minute) and a track from their first album called \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uxt-FnNy2I\" target=\"_blank\">Don't Panic</a>\". I <em>really</em> like this song a lot. It's not just the Douglas Adams reference in the title (which Martin has done a couple of times); it's the combination of the echoing guitar line and the lyrics and the way Martin sings \"And we live in a beautiful world / yeah, we do, yeah, we do\" in the chorus, in a way that suggests that he might not be telling the truth. It's short as hell and lovely and I'll fight anybody who suggests it's not at least as good as a Radiohead song.</p><p></p><p>I don't have \"Yellow\", the band's first big single, on my iPod, because it was impossible to be anywhere in the Westernized world in the early 00s and not hear that song playing. But it's still a great pop single. The lyrics are odd without being irritating, the hooks are solid, and Martin's voice is perfect, with that little falsetto yelp that approximates an Irish <em>séan nos</em> hiccup without actually being one.</p><p></p><p>So I know -- I <em>know</em>, goddamnit -- that Coldplay are or at least were capable of producing good music. Their position as a sort of diet caffeine-free version of Radiohead has been <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-coldplay-to-radiohead-connection-a-video-investigation-20080617\" target=\"_blank\">a running joke for a decade now</a>, but that's fine. They didn't <em>have</em> to be Radiohead. But they could have been a really good Coldplay.</p><p></p><p>The problem, I suspect, is that Chris Martin wants to be liked by everybody. And, as <a title=\"This is Paul Carr looking dashing.\" href=\"http://trendsupdates.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/paul-carr.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Carr</a> pointed out to me the other day, people who want everyone to like them end up being liked by nobody at all, except Gwyneth Paltrow. Coldplay strike me as the type of band who remix their work endlessly and by committee, trying to achieve some kind of sonic Arcadia, a blissful aural landscape of perfectly stadium-friendly bottom end and hopeful, soaring guitars.</p><p></p><p>The result is a sort of musical version of the decorational accents they sell at Ikea in between the Billy bookshelves and the improbably small platform beds. It's fine and nice and goes well with your lifestyle...but it's devoid of any personality. It's free from criticism because it offers nothing of itself. It's wallpaper.</p><p></p><p>I got <em>Viva La Vida</em> because Eno produced it, and Eno is worshipped as a god in my household (or at least in the part of it that's actually my head). I expected a revelation; I hoped that <em>Viva La Vida</em> would be Coldplay's <em>The Unforgettable Fire</em>, the moment when they stepped up their game and became really interesting.</p><p></p><p>This was not the case. In fact, aside from the title track, the music slid off my brain like it was made of Teflon. Aside from the title track, I literally cannot remember any of <em>Viva La Vida</em>, despite having listened to it at least ten times all the way through. (Usually while cooking, which seems to be the ideal Coldplay listening situation, because their music is actually improved by the sound of sizzling hot oil.) \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvgZkm1xWPE\" target=\"_blank\">Viva La Vida</a>\" the song is <em>almost</em> interesting; to my ears, what it's really missing is a harder beat, a more driving bassline. Without it, it's music for car commercials.</p><p></p><p>I'm not going to tell you about <em>Mylo Xyloto</em>, because I got about three songs into it and turned it off. Like all of their post-<em>Parachutes</em> work, it was unlistenable, because it was completely devoid of any corners or edges for the mind to hook in to. It reminded me of those <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=lifestyle%20porn\" target=\"_blank\">lifestyle-porn</a> spreads in magazines like <em>Dwell</em> and <em>Metropolis</em> where bourgeois bohemians show off their exquisitely designed minimalist living spaces. It's pretty to look at, but you have to wonder what kind of madness creeps in after a few months of living in a stainless steel-and-MDF universe. I imagine these people find themselves fighting the near-uncontrollable urge to grab a Sharpie and start drawing giant cocks on the unbroken expanses of off-white paneling that surround them. The same is true for Coldplay; I suspect that <em>Mylo Xyloto</em> would be endlessly improved by running it through a Squarepusher-style glitch plugin that caused it to skip and stammer.</p><p></p><p>Also, Rihanna sings on it. I know a lot of you are convinced that Rihanna is good, and that makes me want to go live in the goddamn Michigan forest with Bon Iver and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Linkous\" target=\"_blank\">the ghost of Mark Linkous</a> and hoard a stack of Nina Simone records until you all come to your senses. Or die off like the dinosaurs.</p><p></p><p>This speaks to one of Chris Martin's more annoying behaviors: namely, his public flirtation with American hip-hop and <a href=\"http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2011/10/chris-martin-to-jay-z-we-dont-believe-you-you-need-more-people/\" target=\"_blank\">his bromances with guys like 50 Cent and Jay-Z</a>. I have no idea whether this is all sincere and legitimate on a personal level, or some kind of surreal attempt to establish \"street cred\", which is a concept completely orthogonal to the very notion of Coldplay, like the idea of the European Union attempting to look sexy at a party. Certainly his attempts to<a href=\"http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/64364/1/Coldplays-Chris-Martin-Rihanna-Is-The-Best-Singer-In-The-World\" target=\"_blank\"> integrate American urban music into Coldplay's oeuvre</a> are an act of absurdist theater that would be offensive if it wasn't such a fucking non sequitur.</p><p></p><p>And maybe a Coldplay record produced by Jay-Z might be interesting. (It's a long shot, but hey, <a href=\"http://www.djbc.net/anotherjay/\" target=\"_blank\">stranger things have happened</a>.) I think Eno's considerable talents are wasted on this source material. What I'd <em>really</em> love to hear is a Coldplay record <em>produced</em> by Squarepusher, or Burial -- someone who could strip away the polish, make it ugly, confrontational in spots, make it not appeal to everyone.</p><p></p><p>They could do it, they really could. I'm convinced that, deep down, Coldplay has the talent to be remarkable. After all, who could have extrapolated <em>Kid A</em> from <em>Pablo Honey</em>, or <em>Achtung Baby</em> from <em>Rattle &amp; Hum</em>, or the Gorillaz from \"Boys And Girls\"? Despite the reputation of the UK music press as being jeering and suspicious when a musical artist tries to rise above their station, British bands seem to have a lot more ambition at reinventing themselves every so often. And like U2 and Radiohead before them, Coldplay's in a position to get their freak on if they so desire, to not only change their own artistic statement (or simply make one in the first place) but change the whole conversation of music.</p><p></p><p>If you're not old like me, you don't remember how completely goddamn <em>weird Achtung Baby</em> sounded after the stadium anthems of <em>The Joshua Tree</em> and the pompousness of <em>Rattle &amp; Hum</em>. And yet, it was one of U2's bestselling records...and you can see the way that it changed the musical landscape. Ditto with <em>Kid A</em>, which was the number one Billboard album for at least a couple of weeks despite being a skittering bleepy piece of Krautrock madness.</p><p></p><p>When you've gotten to a certain point, you can afford to fuck around, try new things, become a new idea. And I wish Coldplay would do it, because as it stands they're poised to become the musical equivalent of a boutique hotel: a tasteful, lovely environment in which no one actually lives.</p><p></p><p>If you're thinking of buying <em>Mylo Xyloto</em>, do yourself a favor and go buy the last couple of albums by <a href=\"http://www.elbow.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Elbow</a> and <a href=\"http://www.jamiewoon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jamie Woon</a>'s self-titled debut instead, and wait in hopes -- as I do -- that Coldplay will eventually produce something of lasting value, because this ain't it.</p>",

                "content": "<p>I attended a meetup for the Occupy Las Vegas movement tonight, which is planning a protest march on the Las Vegas Strip on Thursday. By and large, I was glad to see so many people from so many different walks of life out to support this movement. However, I had some concerns and some suggestions to make sure everything runs smoothly. I recognize that with some of these issues I may sound paranoid...but I'd rather be absurdly wrong about the things I'm concerned about than be even slightly right.</p><p></p><p>In security analysis, one of the measurements you do is <em>threat</em> versus <em>risk</em>; in other words, what am I afraid is going to happen, and how likely is it to actually happen?</p><p></p><p>The risk here is pretty small; I hope and think that Thursday will be nice and peaceful. But there has apparently been some discussion about the possibility of interference by either <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_bloc\" target=\"_blank\">black bloc anarchists </a>or right-wing provocateurs. Unlikely as that may be, it raises the stakes a little. The black bloc goofballs can escalate a peaceful protest into a massive flaming shitstorm in short order; if you don't believe me, ask anybody who was at the WTO protests in Seattle in 1999. And hell, they're nominally on the <em>same side</em>; if any of the wingnuts from Nevada's Tea Party or Nazi groups show up and start getting rowdy it'd be even worse.</p><p></p><p>And while the risk is low, the threat is high. You've got a crowd that's estimated to be between 500 - 700 people, mostly people who've never protested or participated in an event like this before; almost none of them, I'm willing to bet, have ever been in a protest that's gone violent. If badness happened, most of them wouldn't have any idea of what to do. There's been a lot of discussion on OLV's Facebook page about what to do in case of arrests...while at the same time, people are being invited to bring their children, which is frankly fucking idiotic. Don't bring your kids if being arrested or being attacked is enough of a possibility that a bail bonds company is offering fee-free bail bonds to protesters. I mean, imagine if you did get arrested; in the heat of things, are you sure somebody would know to even <em>tell</em> your kid? And who would take responsibility for getting them home safely if that happened?</p><p></p><p>Also, something else to consider: though I understand that both the security teams for the adjacent casinos and Metro are apparently being helpful, don't forget that their goals -- keeping the tourists and their money moving and maintaining order, respectively -- are at cross-purposes to this protest, which is designed to attract attention and disrupt the status quo<em>.</em></p><p></p><p><em></em>There's also the fact -- which no one seems to have pointed out -- that this is a protest against the excesses of capitalism that's being held in the most excessively capitalist place on the entire planet. It's like walking into Disneyland and calling Walt Disney a Nazi prick; you may have the <em>right</em> to do it, and nobody may stop you...but they're not going to be on your side if things go wrong, either.</p><p></p><p>I could keep going, but I hope I've made it clear that the organizers of OLV cannot afford to be naive about this. Hope for the best -- a nice day where people's voices are heard and everyone has a peaceful, wonderful time -- and at least make the minimum necessary preparations for the worst. So here's my specific advice:</p><p><ul></p><p><li><strong>1) Have your security/peacekeeping team walk your route.</strong> Estimate how long it'll take the average protester (which means the mass of the group) to walk the route. Establish checkpoints along the route -- say at the end of every city block. Assign one security person to each of those points, to remain there from the time the group leaves the starting point until the last person passes by. Figure out exit points in case something goes wrong -- if there's violence, you want to make sure people have alternative routes to get away from it. <em>These routes should not involve entering the casinos</em>, because once you do, you're on <em>their</em> property and you can be arrested even if you're not doing anything particularly wrong. Figure out how to get people <em>between</em> the casinos, or through their service driveways, out to Koval to the east or Dean Martin to the west, in case something goes wrong. If it does, make sure your security people know where to lead others to get away.</li></p><p><li><strong>2) Give your security people walkie-talkies.</strong> There was some suggestion that people could communicate via cell phones. Cell phones are a slow and unreliable tool. Walkie-talkies are cheap. Get some. Make sure everybody can talk to everybody else. If a fight breaks out at the front of the mass group, make sure the people at the back of the mass group don't just keep walking towards or (God help you all) surround it.</li></p><p><li><strong>3) Watch the crowd.</strong> Think of a bouncer at a nightclub; the bouncer's job is not to beat up somebody who gets rowdy, but to know <em>who's</em> going to get rowdy and stop them peacefully before they can. Most of the people who are going to show up are going to be good, happy, peaceful people. But statistically speaking, the likelihood is good that at least one or two people are going to be absolutely stone fucking crazy or provocateurs or just drunk. Know who these people are before everything gets underway.</li></p><p><li><strong>4) Keep your cameras out.</strong> I had suggested that somebody track down one of those digital video cameras that always stores the last 30 seconds buffered in RAM, but that's not going to happen before Thursday. So everybody keep your cameras out. If anything goes wrong, film it -- video, still photos, whatever -- and upload it offsite to Flickr or Facebook or Twitter as fast as you can. I don't think Metro is going to start busting heads for no reason, but if they do, you want pictures of it on Twitter before anybody can grab your camera. The world may be watching, but only if you're giving them something to watch.</li></p><p><li><strong>5) Keep families together.</strong> If people really do bring their kids (out of naivete or a lack of other options), keep the people with kids all together, preferably at the back of the group. That way, if anything bad happens, they're not stuck in the middle of it, and they can break off and find safety.</li></p><p></ul></p><p>Again, I'm sure I sound hyper-paranoid. Maybe I am. I hope so. But if I'm not, well...do you really want to see what happens when you take 500-700 of the fabled 99% and start blasting them with pepper spray? What would <em>you</em> do? Would you calmly sit down and wait for the nice policeman to put the zip ties on your hands...or would you blindly run into a street filled with cars driven by drunk tourists who are too busy staring at some goddamn fountain to notice you?</p><p></p><p>So take these simple precautions. It's worth the minimal cost and effort. I'll help, if I can, any way I can. But if these steps aren't taken, I'm not going to be within a mile of the Strip on Thursday, because I won't feel secure in my freedom or safety. This can all go off without a hitch with some careful planning...so let's plan.</p>",

            "source": {
                "content": "<p>Been thinking a lot about augmented reality recently, for fairly obvious reasons. The other night I was talking to <a href=\"http://www.yiyinglu.com/\">Yiying Lu</a> at the first <a href=\"http://www.launchup.org/2011/08/24/launchup-las-vegas-1-sept-14-630-pm-yiying-lu-david-and-jennifer-gosse-advanced-information-systems-ayloo-and-rumgr/\" target=\"_blank\">LaunchUp Las Vegas</a> about AR and the possibilities inherent in it, and it got me thinking.</p><p></p><p>I've always had a big interest in ambient information interfaces and what is apparently called \"<a href=\"http://www.ubiq.com/hypertext/weiser/calmtech/calmtech.htm\" target=\"_blank\">calm technology</a>\". Ambient information is really the idea that much of the information we're required to monitor/process in our daily lives doesn't actually require our complete attention all the time; that our interface to it can be passive, subliminal, rather than active and engaged.</p><p></p><p>For example, several years ago a company called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_Devices\" target=\"_blank\">Ambient Devices</a> debuted a product called Ambient Orb that was basically a frosted globe with multicolored LEDs in it. This device connected up to your various data streams and changed color based on their status. For example, you could set the Orb to glow red if you had unread email, or change color based upon the performance of your stocks. The idea was that you wouldn't have to sit and actively engage with your data; you could reduce it to a simple, nearly-binary yes/no or color-based alert system.</p><p></p><p>The Orb never really did much for me, because it used a weird non-standard wireless network to return data and it seemed pretty locked in to the use cases that Ambient had created for it; I have no need to constantly (or really ever) monitor stock data in real-time, for example. But it was an interesting idea in theory, and one which has never really gone away.</p><p></p><p>The most obvious example of a passive info display is a traditional clock face, with hour, minute and second hands. Most people on Earth can simply glance at a clock and instantly recognize what time it is -- maybe not down to the precise second, but close enough for government work, as the old saying goes. Clocks are both ambient and precise interfaces, of course; if you look at the clock for more than a second you can determine the precise time -- by \"drilling down\" past the \"macro\" interface (i.e. the general geometric configuration of the clock hands) and focusing on the \"micro\" interface (the second hand and the numbers).</p><p></p><p>A more modern example, in my opinion, are the icon \"badges\" that appear in Apple's iOS (and, to a lesser extent, in Dock icons in their main MacOS X). The badge overlaid on the Mail icon, for example, shows you how many unread emails you have. But it also functions as a simple binary indicator: if it's there, you have unread mail. Again, you drill down by focusing on the number inside the icon, which is the actual number of unread emails.</p><p></p><p>This is all very fine and dandy, but I started thinking about one of the basic underlying assumptions in both ambient information and in augmented reality: namely, that the primary interface ought to be visual.</p><p></p><p>In our everyday lives, at least for the non-deaf, sound is our most often-used tool for passively gathering information about the state of our environment. We <em>listen</em> to the world as much as we look at it. And my own experience suggests that my own brain is better at setting audio to a lower cognitive priority than vision, while still paying <a href=\"http://lindastone.net/category/attention/continuous-partial-attention/\" target=\"_blank\">continuous partial attention</a> to it.</p><p></p><p>I suspect this is true of most humans: this is why it is illegal (at least in America) to put a video player in front of the driver in a motor vehicle, but car radios have been with us <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_audio#History\" target=\"_blank\">since around 1930</a>. You can listen to <em>This American Life</em> and simultaneously perform the complex mental gymnastics required to drive a car without killing yourself or anybody else...but very, very few of us could watch TAL's companion TV series on an LCD screen above our dashboard and make it more than a mile or two without ending up in a ditch. I'm sure there's a well-documented neurological reason for this, but I'm gonna just skip the Googling here and say with confidence: humans are better at passively monitoring audio than vision.</p><p></p><p>Musician/artist/producer Brian Eno discovered this in 1975, when he was laid up in bed after being hit by a car. As he <a href=\"http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/discreet-txt.html\" target=\"_blank\">explains it</a> in the liner notes to <em>Discreet Music</em>, the album that essentially launched the \"ambient\" music genre:</p><p><blockquote>In January this year I had an accident. I was not seriously hurt, but I was confined to bed in a stiff and static position. My friend Judy Nylon visited me and brought me a record of 18th century harp music. After she had gone, and with some considerable difficulty, I put on the record. Having laid down, I realized that the amplifier was set at an extremely low level, and that one channel of the stereo had failed completely. Since I hadn't the energy to get up and improve matters, the record played on almost inaudibly. This presented what was for me a new way of hearing music - as part of the ambience of the environment just as the colour of the light and the sound of the rain were parts of that ambience. It is for this reason that I suggest listening to the piece at comparatively low levels, even to the extent that it frequently falls below the threshold of audibility.</blockquote></p><p>This gave Eno the impetus to create \"make a piece that could be listened to and yet could be ignored... perhaps in the spirit of Satie who wanted to make music that could 'mingle with the sound of the knives and forks at dinner.'\"</p><p></p><p>And yet, despite the obvious advantage of auditory interfaces, most ambient information interfaces are still visual displays, like the Ambient Orb. (One notable exception is in-car GPS, which usually uses some sort of celebrity voice to give you <a href=\"http://failblog.org/2011/08/25/epic-fail-photos-gps-fail/\" target=\"_blank\">ambiguous directions</a>.) And, so far as I am aware, the bulk of  augmented reality tools -- which, by overlaying data onto our real environment, are a sort of cousin of ambient displays -- use audio sparingly, if at all.</p><p></p><p>In these use cases, audio simply makes more sense in these contexts. For another thing, playing and even manipulating audio in real time is far less power and CPU intensive than rendering graphics in real time, which is why the iPhone can <a href=\"http://www.ikmultimedia.com/irig/\" target=\"_blank\">serve as a perfectly serviceable guitar stomp box</a>.</p><p></p><p>Imagine, for example, a simple navigation system for a mobile device that directed you towards your destination via the simple means of adjusting the balance and volume of the music playing via your audio player. The sound is \"centered\" when you're facing your destination directly; turn right and the music grows louder in your left ear and vice versa. The closer you are to your destination, the louder the music plays. Such a system would require no engagement at all by the user; the mobile device could remain safe in the user's pocket for the duration of their journey. It's an incredibly intuitive and simple interface to a fairly complex computational system.</p><p></p><p>(Of course, such an interface would be rather annoying on its face for someone who was simply trying to listen to their tunes, but it gives an example of one modality for such a tool.)</p><p></p><p>Talking to Yiying, I was reminded of an old idea of mine: an entirely musical social network based on generative music created via musical \"DNA\". Think about how music discovery apps like Pandora work: each song is weighed against a set of criteria, such as \"slow/fast\" \"exciting/mournful\", etc. Each track's particular set of traits serves as its musical \"chromosomes\" so to speak.</p><p></p><p>So imagine that you sign up for this network and feed it your Pandora or Last.fm playlists. It analyzes your music and creates a <em>new</em> music for you: a sort of personalized, endlessly generated, changing score: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3oeAlOtbkE\" target=\"_blank\">your theme music</a>.</p><p></p><p>Your theme music plays over your mobile device as you navigate through the world -- ambient music, as easily ignored as paid attention to. Now, imagine you walk by someone else using this notional network -- someone else with their <em>own</em> theme music.</p><p></p><p>As you pass them, some magic wireless technology (Bluetooth, near field communications or something powered by unobtanium) triggers off. It randomly merges <em>your</em> musical DNA with theirs, and your theme music is subtly altered by your encounter with them, and vice versa, incorporating elements of their musical genes.</p><p></p><p>This wouldn't be limited to people, either. Buildings, landmarks, communities, even the time of day -- your theme could be endlessly modified by the very landscape you walk through. Over time, your music would become a product of your encounters, your experiences, your movements. (Of course, this is true anyway of anybody's music collection, in a metaphorical sense. But in this case it would be literal.) You could \"follow\" people based upon the grooviness of their personal soundtrack.</p><p></p><p>This is one -- admittedly slightly silly -- example of an auditory augmented reality. But there are more practical and practicable variations on this as well. I'd love to see more people think about and embrace the potential of auditory ambient/AR systems as they become more widely-used and prevalent in the UI/UX community.</p>",

I had ended up homeless up there as a result of a lot of bad craziness, most of it mine. I'd ended up sitting in a place called Café Minnie on Broadway in Capitol Hill, eating a bowl of soup the kind night manager had given me for free, and I'd decided that if I could just get out of this I'd never end up in this situation again.</p><p></p><p>(And I didn't. Mostly.)</p><p></p><p>I'd only been back for a few days. I'd been sleeping on an old futon mattress on the floor of my parents' storage room, and I'd been having fitful, frightened dreams. But if I dreamed the night of September 10th, 2001, I do not remember it. I only remember waking up early the next morning to my mother, banging loudly on my door.</p><p></p><p>I had a headache, I remember that; the banging pulled me out of sleep disoriented and confused in the dark; I hadn't been back long enough to entirely realize where I was. My mom opened the door.</p><p></p><p>\"Someone flew a plane into the World Trade Center. We're under attack.\"</p><p></p><p>\"What?\" I mumbled. It was hard to process what she said. \"Come watch the news,\" she said, and vanished from the door. I shook my head. Someone <em>what</em>? How was that an attack? I thought she meant somebody'd flown a small plane into the ground at the WTC, something like that.</p><p></p><p>I walked out of my room into the living room, where my parents had CNN on. My dad was home from work that morning for some reason, and I sat down and looked at the footage -- a pillar of smoke rising from the side of the tower.</p><p></p><p>\"What do you mean, under attack?\" I asked her. \"It's just a plane crash.\"</p><p></p><p>\"They're saying it was deliberate,\" she said. My mom looked really frightened. But I <em>still</em> wasn't fully awake, didn't fully comprehend what I was seeing--</p><p></p><p>And then I watched as the second plane hit the second tower.</p><p></p><p>It was the first and only time in my life that shock took the strength from my legs. I fell against the wall and slid down it. In that moment, I knew -- I <em>knew</em> -- that things had changed.</p><p></p><p>I had the strongest and strangest sensation I've ever felt in my life: that I'd fallen asleep in one universe and woken up in a parallel reality, one where people flew planes into buildings. I kept thinking I was going to wake up -- again, a cliche of fiction that I'd never actually experienced, and never have since. This wasn't real. This wasn't <em>real</em>. It wasn't real when I saw people jumping from the buildings, something that will haunt me until the day I die. That choice: the fire or the drop? The Pentagon. The collapse of the buildings, all those people running down the street to escape that great cloud of dust and ash, their screams so loud it made the microphones on the TV cameras clip and distort. It wasn't <em>real</em>.</p><p></p><p>Do you remember that day? Were you still in school, then? Were you already an adult? You remember where you were. Sure you do. Everybody remembers where they were on September 11th, 2001, the way people of my generation remember where they were on January 28th, 1985, the way my mother's generation remembers where they were when John and Robert Kennedy were shot, Martin Luther King, John Lennon. You don't forget because these are the days when the world changed, or at least our understanding of how it worked.</p><p></p><p>If you remember that day, you remember that most Americans had <em>no idea</em> what was going on. We didn't know if this was the beginning of a larger coordinated attack. The people on the news -- most of whom, I remember, were in tears at this point -- said that nobody knew what the next target was. The Pentagon had been hit, but there was talk of Los Angeles, the Sears Tower...the Stratosphere in Las Vegas.</p><p></p><p>At the time, I was writing for the <em>Las Vegas Mercury</em>, an alt-weekly which has since gone extinct. I didn't have a car and I didn't have a cell phone, but I knew I had to find out what was going on. So I borrowed my mother's cell and hopped on a bus to the Strip.</p><p></p><p>I got off at the corner of Sahara and Las Vegas Boulevard, in the shadow of the Stratosphere. I expected to see panic, cops, maybe military vehicles in the street. Instead, I saw a regular day in Vegas: tourists walking up and down with their Yards O' Beer as if nothing had happened. It made no sense to me at all -- didn't these people know what had happened?</p><p></p><p>I crossed the street and headed for the Stratosphere, expecting it to be blocked off. It wasn't. What the fuck? The news kept saying Vegas was a target, and the Stratosphere was easily the highest profile target in the city. But the doors were open, taxis were pulling up, people were milling in and out.</p><p></p><p>It didn't occur to me until later that most of these people -- out and about on vacation, playing slots in casinos where even the outside light was carefully filtered, much less news about the outside world -- probably really didn't know yet what had happened.</p><p></p><p>But I did, and so I did something which I like to think of as being reasonably brave and which was probably simple, base stupidity on my part: I walked into the Stratosphere.</p><p></p><p>It may have seemed business as usual from the outside, but on the inside there were FBI SWAT types in paramilitary uniforms cordoning off the entrance to the tower itself. (If you're not familiar; the Stratosphere Hotel/Casino lies directly underneath the Stratosphere tower itself. It's as if you built the Seattle Space Needle on top of a Hilton.) It was scary to see guys with M-16s in a casino. And yet, astoundingly, most of the people at the machines weren't even looking at them. They were still playing their slots. There were a few gawkers, but not many. I think most people were afraid to lose their seat, or didn't want to cash out their credit on the machines.</p><p></p><p>I wasn't wearing a press badge. I was probably in jeans and a t-shirt; I looked like any other tourist. And so I didn't stand out to the two men engaged in intense conversation near me -- one in a suit, one in paramilitary gear. I don't know for sure, but my guess is that the guy in the suit was a Stratosphere floor manager and the guy in the jumpsuit was some kind of supervising FBI officer.</p><p></p><p>It's been ten years since I surreptitiously listened to that conversation, and I didn't record it; but the gist was that Mr. FBI was telling Mr. Stratosphere that he needed to get all of these people out of here, like <em>right now</em>, and Mr. Stratosphere was explaining that he couldn't do it. People wouldn't get up and leave their credits on their slot machines and their chips on the table. After this exchange, the two of them drifted away, and I watched the other guys in jumpsuits going up the stairs to the tower elevators with their guns drawn. They were clearly on edge.</p><p></p><p>I honestly believed -- and, in retrospect, had every right to believe -- that at any moment a plane might go into that tower or a bomb might go off, bringing the entire 1150 foot thing down onto the Strip below. I don't think I was ever quite so terrified in my life. But fuck it, right? I had to <em>know</em>.</p><p></p><p>But nothing happened. No bombs went off, no planes came crashing in. After a while I wandered off down the Strip to try and get a sense of what was going on.</p><p></p><p>As I walked, I went up to random tourists and told them what had happened -- that the World Trade Center had been destroyed by hijacked planes, that there was a strong possibility the country was under attack by an unknown enemy.</p><p></p><p>Most of them didn't give a shit. I remember one couple said \"Well, that's terrible, but we're here to have fun.\" People didn't know and didn't care even when they found out. It surprised me back then; it wouldn't surprise me now.</p><p></p><p>The only tourists I saw who seemed to really get what was happening was an old Scottish couple who had actually been watching CNN in their room. They told me that they were stuck in Vegas, as all the flights had been grounded. Of course, as I learned later, they weren't the only ones; thousands of people were stuck in Vegas for several days, most of them past the end of their hotel reservations, and the hotels had no choice but to give them free rooms.</p><p></p><p>I walked the whole length of the Strip that day, and watched the news coverage into the night. The next day, September 12th, I went to Cafe Roma and sat with my friends watching more news on a small portable TV. That night I went to my friend Heather's apartment and stood on the balcony with my friends and saw something I'd never seen before and, in all likelihood, will never see again: an American sky without a single airplane in it. The world was silent that night.</p><p></p><p>Ten years, man. Ten years in this other world, this other timeline. I still feel like there's a world where 9/11 never happened, just on the other side of reality's thin canvas; a world where Bush never won a second term, where the vicious excesses of the Noughties never happened. Or maybe they would have happened in a different way. Maybe they were inevitable. But the hopeful part of me thinks not; hopes that the bad craziness, the greed and paranoia of the last decade, was a reaction to the horror that properly kicked it off.</p><p></p><p>I still remember how it felt to stand in that casino surrounded by the flashing lights and chirping of the slot machines and be aware, in every cell of my body, that I might be standing in an execution chamber. It sounds dramatic in retrospect, but it didn't feel dramatic at the time. If nothing else seemed real that day, that feeling of death rushing at me like a freight train felt real enough.</p><p></p><p>And maybe I wasn't so wrong, at that.</p><p></p><p>Five of the nineteen hijackers were in Vegas before the attacks; in point of fact, they used Cyberzone, the cybercafe above my hangout Cafe Roma, as their base of communications. I <em>know</em> I must've sat next to them in Roma or Cyberzone, maybe said hi to them in passing. My friends certainly did; in the week after the attacks, the FBI swarmed Roma and took accounts from several people.</p><p></p><p>Ironically, at the time, most of my friends used Cyberzone to play multi-player games of <em>Counterstrike</em>; when you walked in there, amidst the digitized sounds of machine gun fire, you'd hear a voice announce whenever a round had ended: <em>The terrorists have won</em>. <em>The terrorists have won</em>.</p><p></p><p>I am convinced and have been since that day that their presence in Vegas wasn't random or coincidental. And based on what I saw in the Stratosphere that day, I've always thought there was a fair-to-middling chance that the Feds found <em>something</em> up in that tower, and kept it quiet. Vegas relies on tourism, after all...and if tourists thought that jihadis were putting bombs in the casinos, this town would die a quick and excruciating death.</p><p></p><p>I don't know. I don't have any proof. And it doesn't matter, ten years down the road, I guess. Trying to sort out the truth and the lies of 9/11 is a Herculean process that will engage historians for a hundred years. I don't care about any of it, anymore.</p><p></p><p>When I think of 9/11 now, I think of the people jumping. That's what I remember. Because I can't imagine making that choice. No, that's not true, that's not why I'm haunted; I'm haunted because I <em>can</em> imagine making it. And now, at 33, I can imagine it a lot better than I could at 23. I know more about death now. If 9/11 happened today, when I am a married man, when I have seen people die in front of me with my own eyes, I wouldn't have gone into that casino. I would be too afraid.</p><p></p><p>And I'm lying, a bit here: the other memory I have of 9/11, the better memory, is of the days afterward, when we all seemed to pull together. I remember that feeling that, for once, we were all in this together, every American. It didn't last -- and as history has shown, it wasn't really true even at the time -- but it <em>felt</em> true. It felt real. It was hope in a dark moment, and it was important.</p><p></p><p>This week people are going to be waving the flag and the signs that say NEVER FORGET; as if we who lived through that day need those signs, as if we would or could forget it. We all live in the shadows of the Twin Towers now. Every time another American soldier falls in Iraq or Afghanistan, every time a bitter young man whose family died in our occupation slips into his first jihadi meeting, every time another one of our core freedoms is eroded in the name of some notional security, we are in that shadow, and I wonder how long it will be before we can ever get free.</p><p></p><p>And so, ten years on, the memory of 9/11 I choose to cling to is the memory of that togetherness. In the end, when foolish wars and dollar diplomacy fail, it is that and nothing else which may ultimately save us from the dark.</p>",

            "source": {
                "content": "<p>So, I've released a new track for sale on Bandcamp, entitled \"Tully Goes Down To The Docks\".</p><p></p><p></p><p>It's priced at a minimum of $1.00, but you can pay whatever you think it's worth.</p><p></p><p>This piece (arranged for toy piano and strings with some digital effects) is one of my generative pieces, meaning it's entirely composed using software algorithms within Ableton Live. While I've made several of these before, this is the first one I've really felt comfortable charging for, because I think it's <em>really good</em>. It's emotionally evocative and warm, and extremely atmospheric; I'm reminded of a film soundtrack. Hence the title, \"Tully Goes Down To The Docks\", which doesn't actually mean anything. It just sounded like the score for the part of the (non-existent) movie where...well...where Tully goes down to the docks.</p><p></p><p>The process for creating one of these pieces can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours. This one took me about an hour. I created multiple tracks in Live and added looping MIDI clips to them. Each clip consists of just a middle C note, playing a rhythm -- eighth notes, sixteenth notes, quarter notes, whole notes, either regular repeating or in some rhythmic pattern. Then I load in the Random MIDI plugin, which randomizes the playback notes. Then I add the Scale plugin, which forces the randomized notes into a scale (in this case, C major).</p><p></p><p>So the clip sends the middle C note, which is then randomized and then quantized (by being forced up or down) into a harmonic scale, and then sent to Propellerheads Reason, my soft synth environment. In this case, there are three Reason instruments: a toy piano, a solo marcato cello and a string section. The returned audio from Reason is sent to a granular synthesis Max for Live plugin called <a href=\"http://www.partikkelaudio.com/home/press-hadron-released\">Hadron</a>, which provides some really interesting (if subtle) sonic texturing, and a whole hell of a lot of reverb.</p><p></p><p>Once it's all mixed the way I like it (including mastering but, in this case, no compression, as I wanted it to have extremely wide dynamic range), it's done. I save the file and go to \"Render Audio/Video\" in Live's file menu.</p><p></p><p>The length of the piece is arbitrary, but in this case I cheated a bit: I manually brought in each track at the beginning and then took them out one by one at the end. The entire track runs 128 measures (or 8:36 seconds). Every time I play the track (or render it out in Ableton Live) it's different; this recorded version is one of an infinite number of variations on a theme.</p><p></p><p>I could, in theory, create a custom variation for every single person who bought the track, and I'm considering doing that for the next generative piece I do. It'd be interesting: you would own the only copy of your \"version\" of the song. No two would ever be exactly alike. It's a different way of thinking about the idea of recorded music -- one that's really only practically possible with this particular form of composition and recording. (In purely digital music, the two are basically the same.)</p><p></p><p>I hope you like it. I really do. And enough people have bought it that I think it's probably worth doing a possible entire album of these pieces!</p>",

It's called <em>flej-ja-tini</em> in the patois of the Hydrocarbon Ghetto, and downtown they call it <em>muh</em>. Not coffee from a coffee bean, the <em>arabica cappucinoa</em> or whatever the fuck the Latin name is. But it's dark and it's hot and it has precisely the same effect on Martin's nervous system as a venti-triple-bypass of Americano from the Starbucks on Market Street does, so he thinks of it as coffee.</p><p></p><p>Nor is it Chanel Number Five that coats Martin in a molecule-thin layer of sweet-smelling moisture every morning. It's just more weirdness, some quirk of planetary macroweather. High in the stratosphere of <em>O </em>are clouds made of some ratio of water and alcohol, and when the sun hits them every morning, the water evaporates and the alcohol comes falling down and gets impregnated somehow with an organic compound in the lower clouds that smells exactly like attar of roses. It falls and falls, and it lands on Martin, and then it evaporates itself, the way aerosolized alcohol tends to do, and it leaves him smelling like Marilyn Monroe. And also his wife Suzanne, who has been dead for four years now, which is not the reason that Martin will admit to himself he does this little ritual every morning.</p><p></p><p>He pretends to himself that he's letting the alcohol soak into his not-coffee, and also that bathing in naturally-occurring perfume mist is free, whereas an apartment with an actual shower costs money. More than he makes in his pathetic job.</p><p></p><p>Martin Judith sips his <em>flej-ja-tini</em> and tries not to consciously think of his wife, while simultaneous trying to subconsciously comforthimself with the olfactory memory of her and the bottle of Chanel Number Five he bought her on the occasion of their first anniversary, and when the rain stops and the coffee runs dry he heads back inside to get dressed and start his day.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">* * *</p></p><p>Jehsayteh the food vendor is already set up with a line of customers when Martin comes bounding out of his apartment building. He gets in the queue right before an irritable looking Mang, who looks him up and down and flicks its headwings at him contemptuously.</p><p></p><p>\"Fuck off, Tinkerbell,\" Martin says. Despite spending eight of the last ten years living in the city of San Francisco, on the planet Earth, he still has a bit of the accent of Northern England, where he was born and raised. Despite this, when he gives the Mang the finger, it's only the one American finger, not the British V. \"First come, first serve.\"</p><p></p><p>The Mang just buzzes at him. But what's it going to do? It may be eight feet tall, but it's built like a praying mantis and probably weighs all of about a hundred pounds, even with its armored and oversized cranium and the iridescent wings that dangle from it. Besides, it's not looking for a street fight. Nobody looks for a street fight in the Ghettos. Street fights mean cops, and cops mean <em>Show me your ID token, you immigrant scumbag</em>, and anyway three Mangs got deported last week for some kind of credit scam.</p><p></p><p>\"Deportation\" means the same thing out here in the Universe that it does on Earth: the cops take you to the border and throw you over it. But <em>O</em> is an ecumenopolis, a city-state that covers the entire surface of its planet, and in this case, the border is legally defined as the edge of the atmosphere. So the Mang scammers got taken up to low orbit and kicked out of a fucking airlock. Martin doesn't spare them much pity; he's always been fairly confident that he's not racist, but he can't help thinking the Mang are just kind of a creepy species, and their music irritates the piss out of him, and besides, they're a hive mind or something, so they barely even register three dogsbodies doing the Vacuum Mambo.</p><p></p><p>He reaches the front of the line and Jehsayteh grunts a greeting at him. Jehsayteh is an amphibian from some backwater, and he's kind of like a walrus and kind of like a frog, with those weird rectangular-pupiled eyes. He sits in a gigantic plastic bucket filled with swampy water behind his food cart.</p><p></p><p>Martin holds up three fingers. \"I want to have...[er, shit, uh]...three of meat sphere...to please?\" he says in his halting Standard, with a bit of English thrown in. Jehsayteh bounces up and down in his water, which Martin has come to understand is his way of laughing. But he's already ladling three large meatballs and a bunch of sauce into a paper bowl, which he slides across to Martin.</p><p></p><p>\"You're getting better,\" he says in Standard, slowly and over-enunciating, but his tone is friendly.</p><p></p><p>Martin nods. \"I...trying? <em>Trying</em>, yes,\" he says. He waves his cred at the cart, which beeps.</p><p></p><p>\"Keep it up,\" Jehsayteh says, and waves the next customer forward.</p><p></p><p>Martin takes his meatballs down the hill from his street to the waterfront, where the bus comes. He sits on a low wall overlooking the harbor and eats, tipping his head back and knocking the meatballs into his mouth like the jelly balls at the bottom of a glass of bubble tea.</p><p></p><p>He's been here for six months now, he's pretty sure, and he's finally starting to get Standard. As languages go, he's pretty sure it's not complicated; after all, it has to get spoken by what seems like an infinite variety of species with a definitely infinite variety of ways of communicating. It's probably no harder in actuality to learn than the German he picked up when he was backpacking in Bavaria back in the early 90s. The difference was that in Bavaria he could stop at any tourist shop and pick up an English/German phrasebook. There are no English/Standard phrasebooks.</p><p></p><p>As far as Martin knows, he's one of two people within a few hundred light years of here who speaks English, or even knows that English or England or Earth exists, and the other one is an alcoholic counterfeiter who can't be bothered to make himself useful, or to pay for his own drinks for that matter.</p><p></p><p>So he's stuck trying to figure out the language by inference and guesswork and pointing at things until some kind soul feels sorry for him and says what it's called. He feels like even more of a fucking idiot than he did in Bavaria back in the day, trying to suavely pick up sexy German girls with his halfwit's tourist German.</p><p></p><p>It's ironic: in San Francisco, he'd gotten used to Americans acting as if his every Anglophonic syllable was somehow saturated with sophistication and grace -- this despite the fact that his family were working class thugs whose taste for a good union picket line riot was only surpassed by their predilection for finding City fans in back alleys and using their faces to clean the gravel out of the soles of their Doc Martens. But as far as the Yanks are concerned, he might as well be Martin fucking Windsor, Lord Scunsthorpe-Upon-Scunthorpeshire. It took him a long way in California; got him a proper degree in art history and a nice little gallery in SoMA with a respectable Silicon Valley clientele and a loft in North Beach whose square footage could actually be expressed in four figures.</p><p></p><p>And none of that matters now. On <em>O</em> -- or in <em>O</em>, whatever the right preposition for a planet-city is -- here, he's a nearly-mute idiot. He doesn't speak enough Standard to get a job working in an art gallery, much less running one. Even if he could find a female of a species he was both a) attracted to and b) biologically compatible with, he can't ask her out without sounding like he's gotten a recent worrying blow to the head.</p><p></p><p>In fact, in his current situation, Martin is about as marginalized as is possible. Even shady weirdos like the Mang have families and cultural cliques and obscure religious celebrations and music. (Terrible, terrible music.) Whenever any ethnic group finds itself the minority in a hostile place, it immediately bands together and insulates and self-protects and starts pumping out really good food.</p><p></p><p>Not Martin. He's an ethnic minority of one. There isn't anybody else here that he can sit with in a bar and reminisce about the glories of <em>The Sopranos</em>, no cousins he can invite over for a proper British curry or even a Mission District barbacoa burrito, no friends with whom he can serenade the glory of good old planet Earth with a good old fashioned drunken rendition of \"Don't Stop Believin'\".</p><p></p><p>He is alone, and nearly mute, and extremely aware of his status as an illegal and undocumented -- if unwilling -- immigrant.</p><p></p><p>And so he makes his living doing the one job that any illiterate, incompetent, drug-addicted maniac in the universe can always do, for just enough money to not end up in a cardboard box or giving handjobs to obese reptilian religious fanatics in back alleyways. Not that he's done that, or considered doing it for more than five minutes at a time.</p><p></p><p>Martin finishes his meatballs and sauce and reminds himself again to ask Jehsayteh what the fuck his new favorite dish is actually made of, and then decides again that he probably doesn't want to know. He takes a long look out at the harbor, where the shipping lanes to the other continent-districts of <em>O</em> lie adjacent to the massive spaceports and their loading docks. One of those big Partari freighters is coming down, parting the Chanel clouds like a fist through a curtain of gauze, its engine wake sending giant rippling waves across the ocean that crash into the breakwaters with sprays of ocean foam as big as houses that startle the bright red idiot gargoyles that sun themselves on the rocks and send them crying indignantly into the morning air.</p><p></p><p>Martin does not know that he's smiling, but he thinks to himself: <em>fuck, it could be worse. How in hell could you live without seeing that, even just once</em>?</p><p></p><p>And then he's gone into the commuter crowd that flows into the city subways like a river into an underground cavern, gravity driving it ever onward and down into the dark.</p>",

A half-hour of reading articles in <em>Redbook</em> about how to figure out what season you are later, another receptionist pops her head out from behind the garage bay door. \"Can you park your car in the garage for me?\" she asks, and vanishes. You duly retrieve your car and park it in the garage. \"Wait here,\" she says, \"the mechanic will be by in a minute.\"</p><p></p><p>It's not a minute. It's not ten minutes. It's fully forty-five minutes later when the mechanic finally comes into the garage, moving fast, looking at the clipboard with your information. \"Hi,\" he says, and shakes your hand. He seems to deliberately make eye contact with you, as if it's something they taught him in mechanic school. But he only holds it a second, and then returns to your clipboard.</p><p></p><p>\"So what seems to be the problem here?\" he says. Hesitantly, you start telling him. \"About a month ago, my car started making weird noises when it started.\"</p><p></p><p>\"Uh huh.\"</p><p></p><p>\"Then the lights, you know, the dashboard lights and the headlights started dimming--\"</p><p></p><p>\"Uh huh.\"</p><p></p><p>\"I checked the battery--\"</p><p></p><p>\"Uh huh.\"</p><p></p><p>You wait a second, a bit nonplussed. He hasn't looked at you the whole time and doesn't particularly seem to be paying attention.</p><p></p><p>\"I checked the battery, and it's fine, so I didn't know....\"</p><p></p><p>\"Uh huh,\" says the mechanic. \"Well, from what it says here, it looks like you have a blown alternator.\"</p><p></p><p>\"No, but I actually replaced the alternator six months ago--\"</p><p></p><p>\"Uh huh. Well, it's probably still the alternator. Just to be sure, though, I'm going to need to run a complete set of diagnostics on your car, just the standard stuff: full engine check, transmission check, electrical check of course, and then we're going to go ahead and put it in a wind tunnel to make sure it meets manufacturer aerodynamic specifications--\"</p><p></p><p>\"Do we really need to do all that? I mean, couldn't you just look at the alternator, if you think that's what it is?\" You're a bit nervous. You don't actually have comprehensive insurance, just collision.</p><p></p><p>He smiles, a touch patronizingly. \"We want to get a good, complete picture of where your car's at, mmokay? Otherwise, we might miss something.\"</p><p></p><p>\"So how much will all of that cost?\" you ask.</p><p></p><p>He shrugs. \"I have no idea,\" he says. \"It depends on a lot of factors, you'd have to ask my receptionist.\"</p><p></p><p>\"You don't know how much it costs to run these tests?\"</p><p></p><p>\"Nope. That's not really my department. But once we've run them, we can figure out exactly what's wrong with your car and how we're going to fix it, okay?\"</p><p></p><p>He's walking towards the garage door. <em>He's actually just walking away from you towards the garage door.</em> \"My assistant will be by to get you all checked out,\" he says over his shoulder, and then he's gone, leaving you staggering against the side of your poor, damaged car.</p><p></p><p>Another half-hour later, the assistant shows up. Or rather, pops his head in the door. \"Follow me,\" he says, and you do, to a small room with an aging computer on a desk. He sits behind the desk. \"Do you have comprehensive insurance?\" he asks. You tell him quietly that you don't. He sighs. \"Okay, so you're paying the full amount.\" He consults your clipboard, upon which the mechanic has apparently left some notes. He types for a few moments and then his printer spits out a small pile of papers, which he hands to you.</p><p></p><p>You pick them up.</p><p></p><p>You read down until you see the total for the battery of tests the mechanic has ordered for your car, the battery of tests you're fairly sure you don't need.</p><p></p><p>You suddenly feel dizzy. It's more than you paid for the car in the first place...and you bought the car new.</p><p></p><p>\"There's also the cost of your consultation with the mechanic, which you can see here,\" the assistant says, turning over the paper in your hand.</p><p></p><p>You look at him in abject horror, willing him to open his mouth and justify this incredibly ridiculous expense, which -- if your dazed calculations are correct -- suggests that the mechanic is charging roughly $400 per minute of his time.</p><p></p><p>He doesn't. He just nods again. \"Of course, that includes the cost of the mechanic's assistant looking at your car while it was in the garage, before the mechanic showed up, and opening the hood.\"</p><p></p><p>\"Did they do anything to it?\"</p><p></p><p>\"Oh, no. We're not qualified to do anything, we're not actual mechanics. He just made sure it wasn't actually on fire.\"</p><p></p><p>\"I could have told you that!\"</p><p></p><p>\"Yes, but you're not a mechanic, are you?\" He smiles, and it's clear that he's apprenticing to the mechanic in Advanced Condescension.</p><p></p><p>He hands you another, worryingly large stack of paperwork.</p><p></p><p>\"Now, we can set you up on a payment plan....\"</p><p></p><p>You nod, resigned, and sign away most of what you'd planned on earning for the next six months.</p><p></p><p>\"Okay, I've scheduled you for an appointment next week to bring your car in and do these tests,\" he says. You look up in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>\"You're not doing them today?\" you ask. He laughs, genuinely amused. \"Oh, God, no,\" he says. \"Our testing facility is backlogged. But we'll get you in there.\"</p><p></p><p>\"And how long after that 'till the test results come back?\" you ask through numb lips. He shrugs. \"I really couldn't tell you,\" he says. \"Not even ballpark?\" you ask. He shrugs again. \"Probably three weeks,\" he says, \"if you're lucky.\"</p><p></p><p>\"But I'm afraid my car is going to catch on fire or something, or just break, and I need it to go to work!\"</p><p></p><p>He shrugs a third time. \"If it's really that serious, you can take it to the emergency mechanic.\"</p><p></p><p>\"Can they fix it?\" You're hoping he's going to tell you something different from the receptionist did on the phone, but again, he just shrugs.</p><p></p><p>\"Probably not. They're not really trained to do diagnostics. They'll probably just tear out all the wiring and hook it--\"</p><p></p><p>\"Straight to my battery, right.\" He shrugs again. This guy is a master of shrugging. \"That's just the way it works,\" he says.</p><p></p><p>He leads you out the door, to where your car is now sitting, forlorn, in the parking lot. You thank him -- for what, you're not entirely sure -- and get in, turn the engine. It makes the funny noise and you want to turn to the mechanic's assistant and shout <em>Here! That's the noise! Did you hear that?</em></p><p></p><p>But he's long gone, and so you pull away, watching the lights of your dashboard instruments pulse rhythmically as you putter towards work.</p>",

            "source": {
                "content": "<p><em>[I originally tried to actually post this to the \"Web/HTML/info job listings\" area of <a href=\"http://lasvegas.craigslist.org\">lasvegas.craigslist.org</a>, but I had to fill out a thing and verify another thing, and screw it. So it's here instead.]</em></p><p></p><p>I'm sorry, but I've been reading this area of Craigslist for years now and I feel like I ought to say something as a sort of public service.</p><p></p><p>Many of you who post jobs here repost them again and again, which suggests to me that you're having difficulty filling these positions. If I may offer some suggestions?</p><p></p><p><strong>1) You're asking for fictional applicants. </strong>The chances of finding someone -- anyone -- who can do HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, Javascript, C++, Perl, Java, and Actionscript as well as advanced SEO and social strategy and also video production and copywriting is very, very slim. The chances of finding an applicant who does all of these things equally well or even at a competent level are nil. Absolutely nil. You don't know that, because you're simply firing off a list of qualifications you read somewhere. You're trying to fill the work of several people with one person, and you're also...well, that's the second problem:</p><p></p><p><strong>2) The pay many of you are offering is frankly embarrassing</strong>. First of all, paying programmers by the hour is absurd. You pay them a salary. That's how the grownups do it. And offering someone with serious technical skills $9-12/hr to write code shows potential applicants that you're either completely clueless about your market or you're going to be an absolute horror to work for -- the kind of boss who complains when a worker is back five minutes late from lunch.</p><p></p><p>Yes, we're in a recession. But you're still asking someone with complex technical skills to work for the same rate or less than a Starbucks barista. Actually, definitely less, because baristas get tips. Perhaps you'd attract more applicants if you offered to stick a $5 in their tip jar whenever they came up with a particularly efficient SQL sorting algorithm?</p><p></p><p><strong>3) Many of you are extremely firm about not allowing workers to work from home or telecommute.</strong> Frankly: grow up. I've been a professional designer and developer for almost sixteen years and in those years, my experience has been that really good coders don't work well in cubicles, in business casual attire, with you peering over their shoulders to micro-manage every moment of their time. Coding is a technical skill, but it's also a creative endeavor. Not to mention design, of course. On the few occasions I've met with or worked with the sort of employers I'm talking to here, most of them had no idea what hardware/software was required to do even simple Photoshop-based development. They didn't want to buy fonts. They didn't want to purchase stock images -- their command was invariably \"Just go find something on Google\". They make it impossible to actually do the necessary work.</p><p></p><p>I am incredibly good at what I do. Better than the folks you've hired. But if you put me in a carpet-covered cubicle under bright florescent lights with some idiot next to me giggling over the funny cartoon of Obama getting cornholed by a Republic Party donkey and some sweaty middle-managing douchebag who peers over my desk every five minutes to see what I'm doing, I'm not going to work at the same level I do when I'm working at home, connected to my office via Skype or simple IM chat. It's the Web, folks -- I can update your site from a beach in Fiji if I need to.</p><p></p><p>If you pay your devs/designers a salary rather than an hourly wage, you won't feel the need to make sure you're getting your money's worth by demanding they work in front of you. If they suck after their probationary period, fire 'em. Again, that's how the grownups do it.</p><p></p><p><strong>4) Many of you are frustrated by former employers/contractors and want to let us know about your problems.</strong> Perhaps it hasn't occurred to you that the guy who promised to make you a Facebook-killer website for $500 might have been kind of a shady dimwit. Facebook cost millions of dollars to develop and thousands of human-hours. You are not going to make a viable competitor with Joomla in two weeks using the phat logo your sister's kid did in Microsoft Paint.</p><p></p><p>Most serious developers or contractors don't work for less than a few thousand dollars per project. I charge a minimum of $1000 for anything -- setting up a Wordpress site, whatever. It goes up from there. Do you want to know why? Because your four day project isn't actually a four day project. It takes four days for you to meet with me, tell me what you want, ask me what you need (since you almost never actually know), and also tell me you don't have a domain or hosting, and $10/month sounds a bit pricey to you. Finally you'll register the domain and purchase hosting, and then somehow completely fail to understand me when I ask you for your hosting login and password, as they are a small requirement to doing absolutely anything with your website.</p><p></p><p>Then you'll vanish for a week because you don't have the content ready for your site. You didn't actually even figure out what content *needed* to be on your site. You thought I could magic you up an elegant, competitively-featured website with my voodoo. Then it's two weeks of you trying to get as much free work out of me as possible, requesting ludicrous changes and total reworking of major parts of the project.</p><p></p><p>And when it comes time to write that pathetic check for $500 or whatever infantile sum you've decided my time is worth -- three or four weeks of my time, at this point -- you're always still putting your funds together, and it takes another week or two to get the check from you, which is inevitably drawn on the Bank of Addis Ababa or the Chimney Sweep's Credit Union or whatever obscure tiny bank you've invariably chosen to do business with, so it takes another week to clear. At this point, I've done a project for you for roughly $5/hr.</p><p></p><p>I understand that small businesses often don't have big money. Really, I do. But if $500-1000 is the most you can offer someone to build your web-based business for you, you might want to think about doing it yourself. If it's not worth your time to save $500 to learn HTML, it's not worth the time of the guy/girl who already *knows* how to do HTML, you follow?</p><p></p><p><strong>5) Most of you don't actually need a full-time web person.</strong> You just think you do. You need a contractor to do the initial setup work and then take a small monthly contract retainer or an occasional small fee to make modifications to your site's structure or layout. The people you hired who didn't show you how to update your own website content or give you your passwords? Yeah, those are scumbags. They're the kind of people who, admittedly, give my industry a bad name. You can often tell them by their shifty eyes and absolute unwillingness to provide you with logins, source code, or their original project files for graphic design. They usually wear polo shirts to meetings. Don't hire them. Hire somebody who will treat you and your project with professionalism and concern, assuming you treat them the same way.</p><p></p><p><strong>6) Nobody serious is going to work for an employer whose post reads like the scribblings of a five year old.</strong> Your computer has a spelling and grammar check. Use it. Also, if you say \"Don't email me, just hit me up on my cell between 6pm and 9pm and ask for Ray-Jay\", you sound like a creepy freak. Nobody wants to work for a creepy freak, except Facebook employees, and Zuckerberg pays them about a hundred times what you're offering to pay me. (If you don't know who \"Zuckerberg\" is, you probably don't need to be getting into the Internet business.)</p><p></p><p>Now, having said all of this....</p><p></p><p><strong>It's OK to not know how to get this stuff done.</strong> Websites are, despite what your sister's kid tells you, are complex things. It takes years to understand how to make one, much less a really good one. That's what people like me are here for. It's even okay if you don't have a lot of money. I'll occasionally break my own low-limit cap and work for less than I feel I'm worth, if I like the person and feel like helping them. But when I see an ad saying something like \"My last designer was a worthless scumbag and I want somebody who'll just do what I tell them. NO TELECOMMUTING. Compensation: $300-500 depending on experience\", there's no way I'm going to click that link. The guy who does -- the guy who's so desperate for work he'll take on what is clearly going to be a hellish gig -- is going to suck as bad as your last designer or worse.</p><p></p><p>Just keep this stuff in mind, please, when you're posting here to find somebody to help make your Web project a reality. (I don't even know why I'm wasting my time; this will surely get deleted immediately. But screw it, I had to say *something*.)</p>",

(She's not investing money, but I take up a serious amount of our shared living space and time working on Stikki, so in that sense she's my first and most important angel.) So I was trying to explain it not in financial terms, but in <em>human</em> terms: at the end of the day, when you get past the business stuff, what is Stikki <em>for</em>?</p><p></p><p>[caption id=\"attachment_1591\" align=\"alignleft\"  caption=\"The first augmented reality app.\"]<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_Map_of_the_World\"><img title=\"Baylonianmaps\" src=\"http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Baylonianmaps-220x300.jpg\" /></a>[/caption]</p><p></p><p>I'm fascinated by the idea of augmented reality. Not just <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality\">the specific technology referred to by that name</a>, but the whole notion that physical reality can be augmented by abstract, arbitrary information. This is not a new idea; it may, in fact, be one of the very <em>oldest</em> ideas. The first king who looked at the landscape of his kingdom and saw imaginary lines marking the edges of it was the first reality augmenter; this concept is the underlying basis of all human politics, economics, and war, and every part of our culture that descend from them, including the very concept of ownership -- imbuing inanimate objects and places with metadata that exists only in the collective <em>spiritus mundi</em>. All this newfangled frippery of cell phones with GPS and accelerometers is just the latest wrinkle on the very oldest thinking.</p><p></p><p>This extends not just to the big sweeping Spenglerian world of nation-states, but to the very personal. Most humans have a concept of \"home\", a place where, as Robert Frost once put it, when you get there, they have to take you in. As we navigate our way through the streets of our cities, we are constantly aware of a collectively-derived set of metadata about the places we move through. This is a \"good\" block, this is a \"bad\" one; this is a \"hip\" neighborhood, this one not so much. And we also move through our own personal cloud of data. <em>This</em> is where I saw my first concert; I used to work in <em>that</em> building; <em>that's</em> the hospital where our child was born and where my grandfather died; <em>this</em> is the place I first kissed him;<em> this</em> is the place where she finally said goodbye.</p><p></p><p>This is true of every place that humans live, even the most sterile, benighted suburban mall parking lot and the most wretched Third World street corner. We each experience the human landscape in different ways. This may just be a stupid Applebee's to you, but for somebody else, it's the place they met their spouse or the place where they came out to their parents. That may look like a dingy old music store surrounded by bodegas to you, but to a hundred amateur pianists and two professional ones, it's the place where they honed their craft after school on endless etudes with the smell of sawdust and epoxy in the air.</p><p></p><p>Situationism founder Guy Debord defined \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychogeography\">psychogeography</a>\" as \"the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the geographical environment, consciously organized or not, on the emotions and behavior of individuals\". But the abyss cannot gaze into you without you also gazing into the abyss, and probably taking pictures of it and posting them on Flickr and Facebook. Your emotions and behavior effect the environment too. The passing of one human through a place may not physically change it much, but that passing leaves another mental layer of experience on that place. The entire world is covered a mile thick with molecule-thin notional layers of human memory, and what I want to do with Stikki is make a tool that lets us write it down and store it and share it; that lets <em>me</em> tell <em>you</em> my narrative about this place where, at one time or another, we've both found ourselves.</p><p></p><p>One of the things I've thought about, once Stikki is established, is to build plugins or applications for it that will retrieve Wikipedia articles for any given location and display them when you use Stikki there, and maybe an annotation of famous pictures or paintings of that place. And I'd love to see this not just be a straightforward, sober, archival tool, but something artistic: a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauntology\">hauntological</a> remix of all the ghosts of human culture that has been in that place, an aching remembrance of things past, the big and the small, the powerful and the personal.</p><p></p><p>Does that sound vastly ambitious? Of course. But a nerd's reach must exceed his grasp, or what's a Heaven for? And it's not like I'm known for having modest goals.</p><p></p><p>I also want to make a living off of the site, of course. That's why it has ads, and it's why I'm working on figuring out revenue streams that bring something interesting for users to the table. But I mainly want to make something really cool. I'm hoping you think so, and that you use it when the updated version goes into public beta (which I'm hoping will be this week or next; I'm <em>so close</em> right now, just closing up holes and dotting <em>i</em>s and crossing <em>t</em>s).</p><p></p><p></p>",

                "content": "<p><a href=\"http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/apple-icloud11.jpg\"><img title=\"apple-icloud11\" src=\"http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/apple-icloud11.jpg\" /></a>As anybody who knows me knows, I am profoundly ambiguous about the effects of the network on the music industry -- particularly the independent bits of it, such as artists (like myself) who fund, produce and distribute their own music without the benefit of big labels.</p><p></p><p>However, I am completely unambiguous about the recent explosion of cloud-based music services such as <a href=\"http://music.google.com\">Google Music</a>, Apple's<a href=\"http://www.apple.com/icloud/features/\"> iCloud</a> and Amazon's <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive/learnmore\">Cloud Drive</a>...unlike Chicago-based indie label Numero Group, who have <a href=\"http://numerogroup.wordpress.com/2011/06/07/opting-out/\">decided to opt out</a> of Apple's <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/06/apple-announces-itunes-in-the-cloud/\">iTunes Match</a> program, which allows users to pay a small fee to \"match\" the music on their own drives to existing files on Apple's servers, saving them the time and hassle of uploading those files, which could easily be measured in the tens of gigabytes or more.</p><p></p><p>Numero says:</p><p><blockquote>In the coming weeks, many customers and friends will ask us this question: why am I not able to automatically access Numero in my iCloud? The simple reason is that Apple and their major label “partners” have created a reward system that is both incomprehensible in scope and totally out of sync with iCloud’s streaming peers’ (Rdio, Spotify, et al) financial mechanics. As we have been entrusted with an incredible wealth of creative assets, and our primary responsibility is to our partners; the artists, producers, and songwriters that make up the Numero catalog, we feel that Apple’s pittance is an insult not only to them, but every other musician, living or dead, and, if the latter is the case, their heirs.</blockquote></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>While Numero has every right to refuse Apple's program, I think the problem here isn't simply a label opting out of a service: it's a fundamental misunderstanding within the music industry of what cloud storage <em>is</em> and how it works.</p><p></p><p>Cloud storage is just that: <em>storage</em>. None of the music cloud storage providers allow people to obtain music illegally, so far as I can tell: they simply allow users to store their own music collection, some or all of which may be of dubious provenance. But that provenance <em>isn't the provider's responsibility</em>, any more than a U-Stor-It place is responsible for making sure that every item a customer stores in their 8x10 storage unit was legally bought and paid for. All of the providers seem to be taking some steps to ensure that undeniably illegal items (such as leaked, unreleased albums) will be blocked from being uploaded, the same way a U-Stor-It would presumably refuse to allow someone to pull up with a van full of bricks of heroin and dump them in their unit. But if a user happened to have, say, a half-pound of China White at the bottom of a trunk they leave in storage, the onus of discovery isn't on the storage rental business, any more than it's on Google Music if somebody happened to have an \"illegally\" obtained copy of <em>my </em>record.</p><p></p><p>Nor do I believe these providers owe labels and artists money, any more than hard drive providers do, and I think the only reason labels are going after them is because they're much larger targets than the group that labels consider the <em>real</em> enemy: people who don't pay for music. (It has also become deeply unpolitic for a record label to treat the people who pirate their music as freeloading thoughtless assholes, whether or not they actually <em>are</em>.)</p><p></p><p>What labels and artists <em>ought</em> to be doing is working with the cloud providers, because the providers now have a very valuable piece of data: they know what people like, and their sample data is <em>way</em> more comprehensive than that of music discovery tools like Last.fm and Pandora, because they can see each user's <em>entire</em> music collection and how they've interacted with it, not just what they happen to listen to at work or on their mobile device or what have you.</p><p></p><p>For example: I'm a Tom Waits fan, so I have a Tom Waits channel on Pandora. Pandora, in return, gives me links to buy Tom Waits records. But each of these ads is a waste of time. Why? Because I <em>already own every Tom Waits record</em>. I'm not going to buy them.</p><p></p><p>Pandora doesn't know that, because Pandora only sees what I <em>like</em>, not what I already <em>have</em>. But Google Music does. Google Music knows I like Tom Waits, but it can also tell that I have all his records. It also knows that I have several Elvis Costello records, but not all of them. So it shows me an ad not for Waits's <em>Rain Dogs</em>, but for Costello's <em>Blood &amp; Chocolate</em>...something <em>it knows I probably want but don't actually have</em>. And I'm far more likely to buy that.</p><p></p><p>More to the point, for indie labels, it can \"weigh\" my collection and offer me discovery of new/indie music based on an extremely detailed statistical modeling algorithm. For example, I have the Kenny Loggins track \"Playing With The Boys\" in my music collection, but it's there mainly to torment people when I DJ at parties. Since I have no other Kenny Loggins tracks (I swear to God), and the play count is fairly low, it's probably not worth including in a model of my likes and dislikes. But I have four or five <a href=\"http://www.elenimandell.com/\">Eleni Mandell</a> records; even if I don't listen to them that often these days, that still suggests that I like Eleni Mandell enough to have several records, and that I would probably like <a href=\"http://www.jessicaleamayfield.com/\">Jessica Lea Mayfield</a>. But I already <em>have</em> both of Ms. Mayfield's records...so it goes into discovery mode and shows me <a href=\"http://www.leralynn.com/home.cfm\">Lera Lynn</a> instead.</p><p></p><p>And boom! I've just bought Lera Lynn's record, because it's <em>right there</em> in front of me, for a reasonable price, and as soon as I buy it it's in my cloud collection. The barrier to commerce has been lowered so far that it's probably easier for me to buy it than to steal it.</p><p></p><p>This actually has <em>more</em> benefit for indie labels than it does for big labels, because a lot of indie music still lies at the edge of the popularity curve: it's not popular enough to be easily pirated, but by the same token it's also not popular enough to be easily discoverable. If you want the new Lady Gaga record, you can buy it instantly from iTunes or download it in two seconds from The Pirate Bay, either way...but it's easier to buy Lera Lynn's record than to try and find a torrent or even a Rapidshare download for it. (I know, I bought it.) Marrying marketing to the cloud means ads are getting to people who actually <em>want</em> to see them (the most valuable demographic of all no matter <em>what</em> you're selling) and who are willing to act on them, because they actually represent the path of least resistance.</p><p></p><p>I hope the indie labels see this opportunity soon rather than railing at the cloud music service providers, which is a wasted and frankly unfair effort on their part, and focus on how this can actually help them -- because what helps them helps us, the music-loving audience, by giving us an easy way to find and buy new and great stuff.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

                "content": "<p>Dear SimpleMobile Customer Service person,<br /><br />Hi there!<br /><br />As one of your customers, I have to ask: why can't I pay my bill online with my Mac or my iPad? (Even though your site says Firefox ought to work, it doesn't, at least on a Mac.)<br /><br />Assuming your bill pay system isn't made of magic, but a standard HTML form submitted over SSH, there cannot possibly be any good reason to lock out anybody who's not using these two browsers on Windows. If your system is using something like ActiveX that won't work on a non-Windows system, then your web development team are either a pack of raving idiots or actual time travelers from 1999 and you should fire them and hire me to build you something that actually works, and also explain to them as you hand them their final checks that there is no Web technology that works solely on IE *and* Firefox. If it works in Firefox, it works in Chrome, Safari, Mobile Safari, etc. Lots of crappy tech only works on IE, but most web developers avoid these technologies once they've progressed past, say, middle school.<br /><br />In fact, the only technology that won't work on Mobile Safari is Flash...and if your bill pay system uses Flash, you need to call security and have your web team escorted off the premises after being checked for weapons, because anyone who would do such a thing is clearly dangerously insane.<br /><br />Whatever the convoluted and inevitably wrong explanation for this situation might be, the fact is that it's pointless and irritating. I am not going to buy a PC and inflict the horrors of Windows on myself simply to pay my mobile phone bill. Instead, I have to actually go to the store and pay my bill...which sucks when the bill is due on a weekend and the store is closed. (You may ask: if you know your bill is due on a weekend, why not just pay on the preceding Friday? The answer is: I'm an American. Paying a bill even a day before it's due is an act of wretched cowardice, fit only for Communists and probably French people.)<br /><br />I suppose there might be some value to irritating one's customers in this way, but I can't imagine what it might be. I'm not an MBA or anything, but I'm fairly sure that needlessly antagonizing customers is usually considered a bad strategy. (Then again, you are a mobile phone company, and mobile phone companies give out big shiny awards for Maximum Customer Annoyance to each other at industry conferences.)<br /><br />I also can't imagine I'm the only customer with this problem. I suspect that I'm not the only customer who has contacted you about this. Let me assure you that when your customer service person goes down to the nerd dungeon and asks Bob the Web geek about it, and Bob hems and haws and says \"Yeah, I can't really change it, it's based on the architecture of the server, it's all J2EE\" and then continues babbling geekspeak at you for ten minutes, well...Bob is lying. Trust me. I've been building websites since Bob was still trying to make his MySpace page look like The Matrix. I know this to be true, because if Bob knew as much as I did, he wouldn't have thrown up this unnecessary and entirely annoying barrier to commerce.<br /><br />So: please fix this problem. Let me pay my bill with cool computers. Also consider firing the fool who caused it and paying my extremely reasonable rates to have me fix it. <br /><br />(I'm also posting this to my blog, in hopes that the prospect of being embarrassed in front of the seven people and also my mom who read it might drive you towards resolution.)<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Joshua Ellis</p>",

The sponsor selects the radius, and pricing for the ad is based upon that radius. (The value of this sort of advertising, by the way, is that the advertiser <em>knows</em> that the user is within reasonable physical proximity of their business, and is therefore capable of patronizing it.)</p><p></p><p>So here's what I have to do; when a Stikki user visits Stikki, their geolocation is passed (but not stored) to an AJAX script which returns the correct ads for that location, and that's where my knowledge of geometric algorithms breaks down. I don't know what the most elegant way to determine this is.</p><p></p><p>I'm currently using a two-pass approximate sorting scheme that looks something like this:</p><p><ul></p><p><li>retrieve subset of all ads where ad's latitude/longitude is within 5 kilometers of the user's current position (5km being a wide enough radius to contain all possible current ads),</li></p><p><li>within this subset, calculate minimum and maximum lat/long for each ad based on ad's lat/long +/- ad's radius and see if user's lat/long is within it. If so, return ad.</li></p><p></ul></p><p>But I don't know if this is the most efficient way to calculate this, especially if/when I begin to get larger numbers of ads -- more than 1000, say.</p><p></p><p>This same geometric algorithm is used to determine if a user is in proximity to one of their \"alert\" stikkis as well.</p><p></p><p>Anybody have any practical suggestions/advice for this? I could spend the next few weeks learning about collision detection/sorting algorithms, but I'd rather get pointed in the right direction by somebody more versed in geometric algebra than I am.</p>",

I'm not particularly secretive about what I charge (or, as you'll see, am going to be charging from now on) for websites, so I don't think it's inappropriate to put this here.</em></p><p></p><p><em>Some of you may think that there's nothing here I shouldn't have been doing years ago. I agree. The fact is that I have been very bad at business for a long time, and my desire to be helpful to people with small budgets for their web projects has ended up costing me a great deal of time and money. As I am a married man now, I can no longer afford to be \"cool\". I have to be responsible.</em></p><p></p><p><em>------</em></p><p></p><p>Hi there folks!</p><p></p><p>You're receiving this email because you're one of the people I regularly do web design/development business with, and I'm announcing a few changes in my contracting policy.</p><p></p><p>Effective immediately, <strong>I will not be undertaking any website projects with a budget under $1000</strong>. This is non-negotiable. I may take on design projects (such as logo creation or non-production site design) for less, but this is the baseline for hiring/contracting me to make a website. In addition, I will require a minimum of one-third of the project's fee to be paid up front, non-returnable, as a sign of good faith. This is also non-negotiable. I will also be providing scope of work documents for each project, to be signed by both the client (or the client's representative, i.e. you) and myself, so that each party is clear about their own roles and responsibilities within the scope of the project. I will also require that any changes to the project during the course of the work be given to me in writing (via email, preferably) so that there are no misunderstandings or confusion about what needs to be accomplished. Changes made during the project will also require a renegotiation of fees.</p><p></p><p>Each project will include, as part of the negotiated cost, a fixed, reasonable amount of hours dedicated to phone or physical meetings with the client (or with you). If this amount of time is exceeded, I will bill the client $25 per hour of meeting/phone time. Hopefully this will encourage the client to contact me via email, which is my preferred method of communication, as it is much less ambiguous and easier to refer to.</p><p></p><p>In addition, I will be extremely selective in taking on any projects with less than a two week turnaround time; <strong>any such projects will be considered \"rush jobs\" and I will add an additional 50% of my estimated fee to their total</strong>. Also, any timeline specified by the client will be understood to begin when the client provides deliverables such as branding and content, as well as any and all pertinent logins and password for the client's domain name registrar and hosting provider and any contact information for the client that needs to be included within the project's content (such as an email address for a contact form to send messages to).</p><p></p><p>Please note that <strong>these new policies do not affect any projects I am currently engaged in with you</strong>, or projects for which I have already agreed to work on for an existing fee -- merely new projects going ahead from here on out. I will carry out any existing projects for the fee I've negotiated with you. It will, however, apply to any and all projects that are not yet begun. If you're unsure whether a project falls under my new guidelines or not, feel free to contact me about it.</p><p></p><p>I apologize if these changes and requirements are inconvenient for you. However, after a great deal of consideration, I've come to the conclusion that it is simply not economically sustainable for me to work on projects with budgets below $1000. After doing the math I've realized that my current policy of working on small sites for small money means that I am a 33 year old married designer/developer, with sixteen years experience in every aspect of website creation, who makes roughly the same amount of money as a Starbucks barista. (Less, actually: they make tips. I don't.)</p><p></p><p>Also, frankly, I'm tired of dealing with small clients. They're pushy, they contact me at strange hours, they don't have even basic understanding of how the Internet or even their own websites work, they make absolutely unreasonable and unfeasible demands (both in terms of website functionality and turnaround time), and they don't pay on time. They are, to put it bluntly, a pain in the ass.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, it makes more sense for me to seek and take on three or four larger projects a month than seven or eight smaller ones; they're easier and less stressful to manage, and are more financially lucrative in the long run.</p><p></p><p>If you find that you or your clients cannot work within these new policies of mine, I will be happy to refer you to another designer or developer who can better service your needs.</p><p></p><p>However, if you find my terms acceptable, I can guarantee that your clients' projects will receive my full attention and the full benefit of my long years of experience in this field and my considerable creativity and professionalism.</p><p></p><p>Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.</p><p></p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Josh Ellis</p>",

                "content": "<p>Like many people, I'm fairly liberal with the \"Approve Friend Request\" button on Facebook. I'll add friends of friends, casual social acquaintances, former work colleagues, people I went to high school or grade school with or who laid in the adjacent crib to me in the hospital when I was born. I'd say 75% of these people never actually interact with me at all, nor me with them. And that's fine; I don't need to have deep, meaningful conversations with the kid who sat next to me in history class in eighth grade. It's kind of cool to simply see his posts on my main news feed, along with some dude I worked with in 1999 or some girl I went on one date with in 1997...to see small glimpses into lives that briefly converged on mine and then diverged forever.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this means that I end up accidentally friending people who have no actual interest in me, my personal life or the things I create and produce. To these people, I'm simply another notch on their social marketing belt, another name on a mass messaging list, another \"friend\" they can show to their marketing clients as an example of their successful penetration of the social network market. These people don't interact with me. They don't read my posts or comment on them. They just send me endless invites to inane events and \"<strong>Buck Shmerkle Productions is a fan of CLUB ROOFIEZ HIP-HOP LADIES NIGHT!!! and thinks you should be too</strong>\" requests.<br /><br />I despise the marketing and advertising industry. (The fact that I'm a professional web designer, which essentially makes me a sort of marketing sub-contractor, is not lost on me. But that's a whole other story.) I despise people who try to manipulate every single human relationship into a meaningful brand extension opportunity. I want to punch these people in the face very hard and very long until something goes soft behind their eyes.<br /><br />Most of all, I hate people who pretend even casual intimacy with me when their sole goal is to sell me something I don't need or even want. If any of these pricks actually took ten minutes to look at my Facebook profile or Twitter feed, they would probably be able to guess that I'm less likely to attend their \"420-friendly reggae-metal jam!!\" or gallery show of bad derivative paintings or acoustic poetry performance/hootenanny/rally for veganism than I am to shove Jon Cryer's head up my ass whilst performing the entire songbook of Andrew Lloyd Webber in flawless Tagalog.<br /><br />But they don't know that, because I'm <em>not a human to them</em>. They're pimps and I'm a john -- an unwilling and uninterested one. They don't notice if I never respond to any of their messages, never attend their events; they just keep spamming me, day after day, month after month, year after year, under the guise of a false camaraderie. (It's even funnier when these are people whom I know for a fact don't actually like me. You know who you are. Unfortunately for you, so do I.)<br /><br />Luckily, I'm learning to be liberal with <em>another</em> Facebook button: the one that says <strong>Unfriend</strong>. As of today, if you're one of these people, you are not on my friends list. And if you start <em>becoming</em> one of these people, I'll kick your ass to the curb quicker than you can say \"personal brand\". Sorry. Actually, no I'm not. I don't care what you think.<br /><br />This doesn't extend to people who are <em>actually</em> my friends or colleagues or even acquaintances, or people who post events I care about. Even if I don't show up to every play you put on or show your band plays, or even most of them, I'm more than happy to know when you're putting on another event.

                "content": "<p>When I was a very young kid, maybe five, I found the book <i><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Stranger-Than-Science-Frank-Edwards/dp/0806508507\">Stranger Than Science</a></i> by Frank Edwards -- a sort of compendium of Forteana, UFO tales and ghost stories.<br /><br />There was one story in the book about two American women -- schoolteachers, as I remember -- who were visiting Versailles on vacation. As they walked around the grounds, they turned a corner and found themselves surrounded by people in late 17th century clothing who appeared to be having some sort of party. Assuming it was some sort of historical re-creation event, the women observed the whole spectacle for a while, amused...but when they turned another corner, they found the \"actors\" had simply disappeared.<br /><br />Turned out, of course, that there had been no such \"event\" held that day...and furthermore, when the Americans talked to one of the resident historians, they discovered that what they'd seen corresponded with a very specific party held during the reign of Louis XIV, the Sun King.<br /><br />I have no idea of the veracity of this story, but it often occurs to me when I think about the theory of the multiverse -- the notion that there are an infinite number of parallel universes, new ones being formed every nanosecond, each one containing one possible \"timeline\" of probability. (I'm simplifying the hell out of this, of course, but you get the general idea.) In this multiverse, adjacent universes would be almost identical to one another; for example, a nearby universe to ours would be absolutely identical except that one molecule of one leaf on one tree on one planet halfway across the galaxy would be slightly different. Presumably, the further you got away from any given universe (along some dimension perpendicular to linear time, one would guess) the universes you passed through would be more and more different from the one you started from. <br /><br />Because an infinite number of universes would display an infinite number of possible initial conditions, not only any but <i>every</i> possible universe one could imagine, and an infinite number of universes one couldn't, would exist -- including universes where, say, everything was identical to ours, except human civilization started a few centuries earlier, but played out identially otherwise. Such a universe would seem absolutely identical to ours, but if we visited it it would seem like we'd gone back in time. (Dates would be the same, because nobody's counting precisely from the time human life formed or anything.) <br /><br />If this sounds familiar, it's because it's the premise of the Michael Crichton novel <i>Timeline</i>, in which a group of medieval archaeologists have to travel back in time to feudal France, because otherwise it'd be a short and rather pointless book. Crichton pointed out, correctly, that most physicists who subscribe to the multiverse (or \"many-worlds\") theory believe that other universes are impossible to reach from our own; that all of these universes are only permeable from one to another at the very smallest quantum levels of scale, where reality itself seems to break down entirely.<br /><br />But here's my question: if all of the \"adjacent\" universes are essentially identical to our own, <i>how would you know if you'd walked out of one and into another</i>, if everything was exactly the same except our one molecule on one leaf on one tree on one planet ten thousand light years away? How do you know it's not happening all the time, a dozen or a hundred or a million times a day, you flitting from one reality to another, like walking back and forth across the border between one US state and another? What if we exist not in a single universe, but in a sort of cluster of probabilities, universes almost but not quite exactly the same?<br /><br />And what if, one time out of a million or billion or trillion, you walked out of your own \"home\" universe into one that <i>wasn't</i> identical enough as to be unnoticeable? One where, for example, it was still the 17th century, on a lazy summer day when Louis the Sun King was having a revelry in his country palace?<br /><br />I'm not saying I believe this, or even necessarily think it's possible. I see no reason why it <i>couldn't</i> be possible, though the notion is a bit too tough for Occam's razor to easily cut.<br /><br />But what if the fundamental way reality works is much more complex than we think? And what if those teachers weren't mad or lying? <br /><br />What if they simply walked through a hole in one universe and spent a charming afternoon in another?</p>",

Then, when you took the gun out of my mouth, I'd tell you that The Indelicates are like Belle &amp; Sebastian meet Gilbert &amp; Sullivan meet <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacco_and_Vanzetti\">Sacco and Vanzetti</a>. And that's the last I'll say on the subject.</p><p></p><p><em><a href=\"http://corporaterecords.co.uk/artists/The+Indelicates/David+Koresh+Superstar/\">David Koresh Superstar</a></em> is a concept album, which is normally one of the more loathsome excesses of pop music. Or perhaps it's a cast recording of a stage musical that never happened (at least, not yet): the life of Vernon Howell, better known to you and I as David Koresh, leader of the Branch Davidian Church of Waco, Texas, who collectively had a standoff with the federal government in 1993 that ended with Bradley tanks and machine guns and most of Koresh's followers finding out firsthand if there really was a Heaven or not.</p><p></p><p>I grew up in Texas, not terribly far from Waco (though on the other side of Dallas), held in the bosom of that Old Time Religion; my great-grandfather was a minister -- albeit a Methodist one, and Methodists are sort of like the caffeine-free diet Coke of Protestantism. We didn't roll in the aisles or speak in tongues. (Though I did know a mentally challenged kid who became a snake-handling preacher after high school; he was once sodomized with a <a href=\"http://www.figurerealm.com/Galleries/gijoeclassiccollection/Golobulus1.jpg\">Golobulus G.I. Joe action figure</a> by another kid while rummaging in a Dumpster, and I always wondered if that had anything to do with his later career choice. That's a whole other story, though.) Texas Methodists are far more into Sunday potlucks and preachers in business casual playing acoustic guitar on the pulpit than any of the shit Koresh apparently got up to. But Texas is chock full of demented religious fervor, and I certainly knew and was exposed to a lot of people who fully believed that the Rapture was coming, possibly next week. You could tell who they were, because their big American cars all had bumper stickers <a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_B1LlYh6iKqs/Ss09ULIhPiI/AAAAAAAAA6Q/dN7hger-tSY/s400/funny-bumper-sticker-8.jpg\">warning of uncontrolled vehicles, were the Rapture to occur whilst they were driving</a>.</p><p></p><p>Besides, Texas breeds lunatics. (I'm living proof.) In <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3GpbBtCx7Q\">his brilliant and venomous routine about the Waco standoff</a>, Bill Hicks said \"Lemme see here: frustrated rock musician with delusions of grandeur, armed to the teeth and ready to fuck anything that moves. I don't know how to tell you this...but that sounds like all of my friends in Austin.\"</p><p></p><p>My point is that when Koresh went apeshit, it wasn't actually all that surprising; and, as Hicks also pointed out, there's a lot of evidence that the FBI and BATF's handling of the standoff was a colossal clusterfuck, and that they basically slaughtered the Branch Davidians and Koresh...who were loopy, but not possibly actually breaking any laws; for foreigners and other aliens, it is not illegal to own a military-grade weapons cache in Texas. (Nor is it illegal to kill someone who comes onto your property without your permission; one of the funniest things to me, in the world, is that very little of what Leatherface does in <em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> is actually against the law, since the teenage kids not only come onto his land without permission, but actually <em>walk into his house without being given permission</em>. As far as I know, the Texas law about defending your property from intruders doesn't specify <em>how</em> you have to kill said intruders.)</p><p></p><p>It's really interesting to hear the Indelicates' take on all of this. I guessed, and Simon Indelicate <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/simonindelicate/status/70223609485996032\">confirmed</a>, that he's a fan of Garth Ennis's remarkable, bloody, blasphemous and wholly incredible comic series <em>Preacher</em>, which -- like <em>David Koresh Superstar</em> -- deals with the trials and tribulations of a Texas preacher, albeit a very different one. Ennis is Irish and the Indelicates are British, and in both cases their Texas is a mythical landscape of gun-toting God-ridden white trash, a post-apocalyptic frontier landscape filtered through a thousand cowboy movies and the endless parade of embarrassing stories about the place in the global media. It's strange to hear the voices of this passion play singing with English accents, the way it's odd when an occasional Britishism comes out of the mouth of <em>Preacher's</em> Jesse Custer, but of course these characters aren't really Texan; they inhabit a notional Lone Star State.</p><p></p><p>The album follows Koresh's life from his childhood to his ascension (if you can call it that) to cheap roadside messiah, and eventually to his sudden backhanded step into the global spotlight as a crazed cult leader who reportedly sport-fucked his way through the ranks of his female congregation and, of course, eventually led most of them to a horrible death at the hands of the Feds.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/artist-l.jpg\"><img title=\"artist-l\" src=\"http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/artist-l.jpg\" /></a>Both structurally and musically, it bears echoes of Luke Haines's <a href=\"http://issebono.blogspot.com/2009/09/baader-meinhof-baader-meinhof.html\"><em>Baader-Meinhof</em> record</a>, which similarly narrated the history of the Red Army Faction. It has the same odd elements of 70s funk and acoustic folk; the similarity is most evident on opening track \"Remember The Alamo\", first single \"I Am Koresh\", and particularly \"McVeigh\", an almost-disco track about Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh that's reminiscent of \"There's Gonna Be An Accident\" from <em>Baader-Meinhof</em>. It has always been apparent that The Indelicates are fans of Haines, his relentless acerbicism and his various musical products (The Auteurs, Black Box Recorder); it would seem like pastiche except for the fact that Simon Indelicate is at least as good a lyricist as Haines is, and certainly at least as clever. I would provide examples for you to pore over, but I don't have a copy of the lyric sheet for <em>DKS</em>, so you'll have to trust me.</p><p></p><p>The Indelicates aren't playing this for cheap laughs, though the album is shot through with the darkest of black humor: it's obvious that behind the absurdity and uniquely American excesses of Koresh's tale, there's a story about a frankly pathetic man whose delusions created a great deal of horror and terror for a group of people without the innate capacity to see through his cheap bullshit; brainwashed cultists or not, the Indelicates refuse to make them -- or Koresh himself -- the butt of the joke, and it turns what might have been a simplistic and cruel comedy record in less deft hands into a genuinely tragic musical story.</p><p></p><p>Not that they don't use <em>DKS</em> to strike a few blows at the pomposity of musical theater and the notion of the \"concept record\" itself. \"The Road From Houston To Waco\", Koresh's first-person narrative of his life, sounds like a Broadway composer's notion of country music (which sounds, to my ears, oddly like 70s-era Jimmy Buffett). \"Something Goin' Down In Waco\" has a chorus of various voices that sounds like the unbearable moments in musical theater when spoken lines are shoehorned into sung lyrics. (If it's not obvious, I labor under a lifelong hatred of musical theater.)</p><p></p><p>If <em>DKS </em>has an obvious flaw, it's one that's endemic to this genre of work: namely, a lack of subtlety. It's very hard to write narrative non-fictional lyrics while still wrapping yourself in nuance and metaphor; a great example is Dylan's \"Hurricane\", which is maybe his least poetic work (while still being a kickass song). Doing an entire <em>album</em> means you're sacrificing poetry for description; you stop asking questions and start making declarations. Simon balances this here as best he can, but you do lose a bit of the complexity that makes his work so interesting normally.</p><p></p><p>On the whole, though, I think <em>David Koresh Superstar</em> does precisely what it's supposed to do, and does it perfectly well. The album's story ends with \"Superstar\", a melancholy ballad in which Julia Indelicate seemingly plays the part of an angel receiving Koresh into the afterlife, stripping him of his self-illusions and informing him of his precise place in history -- which, according to many theologians and thinkers, would place him firmly in Hell. \"The Texas sky is great and wide, the ashes drift away / Stutters and drifts away,\" Julia sings in her Received Pronunciation accent, and a piercing violin rides Koresh to his judgment.</p><p></p><p>The album ends properly with a gospel-style reworking of the old blues song \"John The Revelator\", complete with choir, which Simon spits out with his characteristic venom. It's a folk apocalypse, absolutely apropos as a coda to the story of a man who believed himself to be the American Messiah, only to discover at the end that no one at all was going to pluck him from the flames and carry him aloft on the wings of angels -- his final and perhaps most important revelation, you might say.</p><p></p><p>I'll be honest: when The Indelicates (who, full disclosure, are Internet friends of mine) announced this project, I was a bit nonplussed. But <em>David Koresh Superstar</em> absolutely surpassed my expectations. The Indelicates manage to capture both the deranged eschatological fervor of the Branch Davidians and the bland suburbanism of their aspirations. It's a challenging and fascinating work from a fascinating and challenging band, and well worth your time.</p><p></p><p><em>David Koresh Superstar </em>is <a href=\"http://corporaterecords.co.uk/artists/The+Indelicates/David+Koresh+Superstar/\">available via a pay-as-you-like mode</a>l from The Indelicates' record label, Corporate Records.</p>",

                "content": "<p>Here's a quote from <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/15/the-chilling-story-of-genius-in-a-land-of-chronic-unemployment\">an amazing TechCrunch article about former and current Nigerian 419 scammers</a> by Sarah Lacy:</p><p><blockquote>Boakye’s sheer hacker genius was the most astounding. It’s not just technical ability– he tries to figure out how the person who set up the security system he’s trying to break thinks, and outsmart him at his own game. If he can’t crack the software, he studies the hardware and learns its vulnerabilities.</p><p></p><p>The way he described the chess match with this unknown nemesis reminded me of another entrepreneur in the Valley: Dennis Fong. Fong spent his teens as a professional gamer, better known by the name “Thresh.” He rarely lost thanks to an uncanny ability to anticipate opponents’ moves. Opponents called it “Thresh ESP,” and it earned him six-figure computing endorsement deals. The way Boakye explained how he breaks into multi-national banks was identical to Thresh’s approach. I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s hacked into at least one of my accounts by now just out of curiosity. I asked him not to do anything malicious, and he promised he wouldn’t. But we were both pretty convinced he could.</p><p></p><p>As a person, I found these meeting more terrifying than my run in with Bones and his machete men in Alaba. As a business reporter, I couldn’t stop the broad smile from spreading across my face as we spoke, even breaking out in laughter once or twice. It’s the same Cheshire cat grin I get when I meet any amazing entrepreneur, anywhere in the world. You know them after five minutes of conversation. And several of these guys just had it. Born into a different circumstance, they could be on the cover of any magazine, ringing the opening bell at the Nasdaq.</blockquote></p><p>The article also points out tha<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/13/yes-there-are-tech-startups-in-nigeria-here-are-my-favorites/\">t Nigeria's small but fierce tech entrepreneur community</a> is furious at the 419 scammers (or \"Yahoo boys\" as they're called in Nigeria) for providing the ugly global face of Nigerian technology.</p><p></p><p>I have long been an advocate for an African technology community and industry. As Lacy points out in the quote above, the problem isn't lack of ambition or knowledge; the problem is hooking into the outside global economy. (And probably things like endemic government corruption, one of the nasty legacies of Western colonialism everywhere.) The 419 scams always struck me as a fascinating example of the interface between the First World and the Third World; the criminals were the ones who caught on first and hardest on how to get the white man to part with his money.</p><p></p><p>One of the biggest hurdles for an African tech economy is that there's no built-in local market for most tech revenue streams, aside from connectivity (re: cell phones, Internet cafés, etc.).There's no b2b market and very little consumer market, because most people don't have a whole lot of money. The real money for African tech companies, as far as I can tell, is exporting tech goods and services to the West...which means, as I said, that African entrepreneurs have to figure out how to hook into Western markets. It's not just an economic problem; it's also cultural, especially given the unfortunate reputation that Nigeria and other African countries have in the West, technology-wise.</p><p></p><p>(This is mostly conjecture on my part; I can't claim to have any firsthand knowledge of Africa's tech industry, other than things I've read and heard from people who've lived and worked over there.)</p><p></p><p>It would be wonderful to see a self-contained tech industry appear in Nigeria and Ghana and other West African nations. Most of the success stories I've heard seem as though they're related to hardware and infrastructure-building (such as mobile phone-based projects). I can imagine why: mobile phones are usually subsidized by carriers whose main revenue stream is based on service contracts, and in a country like Nigeria where <a href=\"http://blogs.cgdev.org/globaldevelopment/2005/04/a-buyback-to-resolve-nigerias-debt-problem.php\">the average income is $330 per year</a>, that means that mobile devices are probably often the primary technology that people are working with. It would be interesting to see how something like <a href=\"http://www.google.com/chromebook\">Google's new strategy of renting netbooks monthly</a> would go over there.</p><p></p><p>Personally, I wish there was more focus in the West on investment in African entrepreneurship rather than in relief aid. Don't get me wrong; I fully understand that, for most Africans, technology advancement comes a distant second to having enough food and not getting murdered by some <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Kony\">random lunatic asshole</a>. But that doesn't mean there's not a solid place for us to focus on helping Africans help themselves, whether it be by helping to provide educational resources or straight-up venture capitalism.</p><p></p><p>I'd love to get involved in these sorts of initiatives, but a) I don't have any money to invest, and b) I'm not a hardcore enough techie that my skillset would be appealing to nonprofits or anybody else trying to help start initiatives in Africa. I don't have a BS (much less a master's degree, which is often a requirement) and I'm a talented generalist, not a specialist. (I still think I would be extremely useful to any such organization, but the few times I've reached out and offered my services I've mostly been ignored.)</p><p></p><p>The day will come, though, when Africa becomes a force to be reckoned with in technology. Twenty years ago, who would've believed that India and Bangladesh would be hubs of technology labor? The wheel always turns; eventually, it's going to turn south.</p>",

I told him I wanted to make a three in the morning dive bar record; music for drunk brokenhearted dudes who read Nietzsche and sultry girls in cocktail dresses with whiskey voices.

                "content": "<p><img title=\"douglas_adams340x225\" src=\"http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/douglas_adams340x225.jpg\" />In 1987, when I was nine years old, I was living in the tiny village of Afşin, Turkey, with my grandparents -- my grandfather was working on a coal refinery project for TEK (the Turkish electric company). We lived in a little compound for the expatriate workers, made up of a few blocks of Soviet-style apartment buildings, some small brick houses, a commissary that kept us in American and European cereal and bootleg VHS tapes of American TV shows, and a pub that served Turkish Efes beer and the most amazingly wonderful greasy-as-hell pizza I've ever eaten.</p><p></p><p>There was also a \"library\" of sorts: a small storage room in the basement of one of the buildings, filled with paperbacks and book club editions of pop novels and such. It never occurred to me, until this moment, to wonder where the books came from; I guess they were just donated by various people working on the projects over the five years or so they were there.</p><p></p><p>I was a bibliophile, even at nine years old. I learned to read rather astonishingly early -- my mother says I was reading signs aloud at the age of about eighteen months -- and I've been a speed-reader my entire life. By the time I ended up in Turkey, I was already reading at least at a high school level. I <em>devoured</em> books, and still do to this day (one of the many things I have in common with my wife). By the time I discovered our compound's little library, I had probably already read all of the books I'd brought with me from America, as well as the <em>Asterix The Gaul</em> comics my grandparents had picked up for me in Istanbul.</p><p></p><p>So I was eager to find something new in the maybe half-dozen shelves of the library. But most of it was Harlequin-style romance, a few technical engineering manuals, Harold Robbins and Stephen King, whom I was terrified of. (It took me at least a year or two after returning from Turkey to get into Big Steve's stuff.) Nothing that looked really interesting to me.</p><p></p><p>And then I found a small Pan Books paperback, well-worn already, with a picture of a little green grinning sphere on the cover giving the reader a raspberry, and a giant hand with a thumb on it. The title was <em>The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Gala</em>xy<em>. </em>The author was Douglas Adams.</p><p></p><p>I picked it up, sat down on the floor of the library, and began reading. When I got to the sentence \"<a href=\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Chapter_3\">The ships hung in the air in much the way that bricks don't</a>,\" I was absolutely hooked...and I have been ever since.</p><p></p><p>Fast-forward many years, to May 11, 2001, ten years ago to the day. I was living in Seattle at the time, in the middle of, shall we say, difficult circumstances. I turned on my computer, logged on to Yahoo! News, and saw the headline: \"Author Douglas Adams dies\". The article said that Adams had died while exercising at his home in Santa Barbara. He was exactly two months past his forty-ninth birthday.</p><p></p><p>I went outside, and I sat on the little concrete stoop of the house I was living in, and I cried. I cried as if a close friend had died, despite the fact that I never met Douglas Adams and only had one very brief email correspondence with him. (It consisted of me asking to interview him for a magazine and him promising to let me do so once the novel he was working on, <em>The Salmon Of Doubt</em>, was finished, which he expected to be very soon. That was 1996. He still hadn't finished it at the time of his death. That was, as I understand it, par for the course for Adams.)</p><p></p><p>In many ways, Adams was responsible for making me who I am today. I found his work at an extremely pivotal moment in my mental development, when the world was just beginning to really open up for me. Something in me responded instantly to his particular type of existential absurdism, even at the tender age of nine. I was a terribly geeky kid, obsessed with physics and astronomy and computers, and the worlds of Arthur Dent and Dirk Gently were the kind of worlds I wanted so desperately to live in -- worlds where particle physics formed the basis of all the best parties. Anyone who knows me and knows his work can probably guess that the foundation of my sense of humor lies in Adams's work. Adams opened me up to a whole world of new ideas -- Monty Python, P.G. Wodehouse, <em>Doctor Who</em>. (I even forgive him for his occasional digs at Rolling Stones fans.)</p><p></p><p>By all accounts, Douglas Adams was a kind, funny, excitable, garrulous and very large man who seemed incapable of ignoring the wonder of the world he found himself in. His intellectual curiosity -- and ability to always place even the most monumental of events, ideas and scientific theories into a very silly frame -- has been an inspiration to me my entire life. Though I never met him, I miss him terribly -- I miss his <em>voice</em> -- and I am envious of those lucky people who got to know him and have him in their lives.</p><p></p><p>Man, I wanted to be Ford Prefect so bad. I used to throw myself at the ground, trying to miss.</p><p></p><p>It never worked. But I still keep trying.</p>",

                "content": "<p>One of my friend Alex's hard and fast rules is: <em>never talk to the Internet people</em>. Don't read blog comments, don't reply to blog comments, don't get in flamewars. It's a rule I follow myself, by and large; I almost never read blog comments <span style=\"color: #808080;\"><em>(Update: except here, of course)</em></span> and never, ever, <em>ever</em> engage in debates within them. In my considered opinion, blog comments tend to be a home for trolls. Most people who comment on my blog posts or tweets do so either directly in Twitter or in Facebook, where most of my data gets cross-posted. And I'm fine with that; I've actually gotten comments from non-friends on Twitter to things I've said that genuinely made me rethink what I was saying.</p><p></p><p>One of the most unfortunate notions in our current society is the idea that every person's voice deserves to be heard. By this I don't mean that people don't have the right to speak; I believe in absolute freedom of speech, even for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westboro_Baptist_Church\">those</a> I <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Party_movement\">most</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design\">despise</a>. But I don't believe that anyone is innately entitled to an audience for their speech, or to have their speech carefully considered or taken seriously by society as a whole. If you want to be taken seriously, you need to earn that right, by saying something worth listening to.</p><p></p><p>I've found that nothing enrages a person more than having their opinion summarily dismissed. Hence the Tea Party, which is primarily comprised of people who feel as though their voices aren't heard in the public forum. By and large this is true, but it's also for good reason: judging by what they <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/pargon/sets/72157623594187379/\"><em>do</em> say (and write on placards) when the cameras are on them</a>, most of them seem to have much the same capacity for reasoned and critical thought that a ring-tailed lemur has for forming a really good metal band. We ignore them not because they're poor or disenfranchised; we ignore them because they're ignorant and stupid -- and willfully so, in a country with some of the best access to educational tools on Earth -- which, ironically, most Tea Partiers and similar right-wing libertarian types<a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-12-09/how-the-tea-party-will-destroy-school-reform/\"> seem to want to get rid of entirely</a>. I can only assume that this is because walking past a school or a library fills them with shame and self-loathing.</p><p></p><p>I don't engage these people in debate either on the Internet or in real life. What's the point? They don't listen, they seem incapable of understanding a nuanced position, they simply want to be told that they're right, and also that Barack Obama was actually born on a small moon orbiting Tau Ceti and that he's merely laying the groundwork for an invasion of aliens who will invade our country and then sit on their lazy tentacles all day, doing nothing but soaking up our welfare dollars.</p><p></p><p>Why would I waste a minute of my time listening or even talking to these sad specimens of the American gene pool?</p><p></p><p>For this stance, I am occasionally asked that most American of questions: <em>who are you to judge other people?</em> My answer is: I'm a guy who paid enough attention in grade school to know the proper usage of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophone\">homophones</a> like \"there\", \"their\" and \"they're\" or <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/pargon/4468906943/in/set-72157623594187379\">\"your\" and \"you're\"</a>. I don't believe the world is six thousand years old, because I get my cosmology from<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/7976594/Stephen-Hawking-God-was-not-needed-to-create-the-Universe.html\"> people who actually study the universe</a>, not a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible\">collection of oral folk tales invented by nomadic goat herders</a> in the days when bronze was still a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_age\">daring and radical new invention</a>. (I've also personally stood in<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87atalh%C3%B6y%C3%BCk\"> a city that is demonstrably older than that</a>, but don't take my word for it.) I can not only spell \"Afghanistan\", but I know where it's located on a map of the Earth, and why it's so <a href=\"http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/20thcentury/articles/sovietexperience.aspx\">goddamn difficult</a> to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Anglo-Afghan_War\">fight any kind of war</a> there. I've been lucky enough to live in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey\">one Islamic country</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt\">visit another</a>, and gain some small understanding of the differences between that culture and my own -- an understanding which is desperately necessary in our times.</p><p></p><p>Most of all, I'm someone who believes that no intellectual or ideological position is worth holding unless it can be sustained against criticism and debate, both internal and external; that if you cannot successfully defend your opinion on a topic, you probably shouldn't have one; and that your only guarantee of admittance into the global forum of public conversation is your ability to be articulate, intelligent, coherent and convincing in the things you choose to say.</p><p></p><p><em>That's</em> who I am to judge.</p><p></p><p>Now, then: if you spend any time online, you're probably aware of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA\">CAPTCHAs</a>. The most useful one, in my opinion, is <a href=\"http://www.google.com/recaptcha\">reCAPTCHA</a>, which not only ensures that the user is human, but uses their innate language-recognition skills to help <a href=\"http://www.google.com/recaptcha/learnmore\">digitize books</a>. CAPTCHAs are not infallible ways of preventing spam, but they've done a lot to lower the volume.</p><p></p><p>I'd like to propose something along similar lines, but in a different direction: a web service that inserts a different sort of CAPTCHA into a blog or news website, one that's not aimed at blocking spam bots, but blocking cretins: an intellectual CAPTCHA. (I'm aware that I'm not the first person to come up with this idea, but I think the others who came before me were kidding. I'm not.)</p><p></p><p>I think the following mockups pretty well sum up my idea:</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/iqcaptcha.jpg\"><img title=\"iqcaptcha\" src=\"http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/iqcaptcha.jpg\" /></a></p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/iqcaptcha2.jpg\"><img title=\"iqcaptcha2\" src=\"http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/iqcaptcha2.jpg\" /></a></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Such a tool would be perfectly accessible to visually-impaired Web users, utilizing audio cues for both the example sentence and the option words (which would be spelled out: \"W-O-U-L-D apostrophe V-E\"). It would simply present a barrier to anyone without basic literacy skills.</p><p></p><p>An argument could be made that this also presents a barrier to persons with reading difficulties such as dyslexia. My response is that finding the correct answer to these problems is really only a simple Google query away. Or you could include a link to <a href=\"http://theoatmeal.com/comics/misspelling\">this helpful visual aid</a> within your iqCAPTCHA. In this way, an iqCAPTCHA could not only weed out undesirable commenters, it could serve as a valuable learning tool for those who feel the uncontrollable urge to post their deathless thoughts to a primarily text-based Internet without the benefit of basic literacy skills. And frankly, if they're not willing to work for it, fuck 'em anyway.</p><p></p><p>I am absolutely, 100% serious about this. I think that it might serve as a very small way of rebalancing the signal-to-noise ratio of the \"conversation\" we're all apparently having (even with people we wouldn't actually piss on if they were on fire in real life). It would work similarly to reCAPTCHA, as a web service you would sign into and create an API key for. A Wordpress plugin would be an absolute must, and optional adoption by Tumblr and Blogger and Facebook would go a long way towards significantly reducing the assheadedness of Internet discourse in an expedient fashion.</p><p></p><p>If you're interested in such an idea, let me know in the comments below. (Which are currently only protected by a reCAPTCHA, so if you're an idiot, you can still be included in this forum...for now.) If enough people are interested, I'll do it and set up a PayPal donation box or something.</p>",

                "content": "<p>I've been thinking about writing down some of my thoughts on philosophical/scientific things that interest me...or rather, the questions that I ask and the responses I've come up with to them. This is not meant to be any sort of formal essay or argument; merely a collection of ideas I've had. Feel free to think about them or ignore them as you choose.</p><p></p><p>The two most important questions I can think of are:</p><p><ul></p><p><li><strong>What is human consciousness?</strong></li></p><p><li><strong>Does human consciousness play any part in the way the universe works on a fundamental level?</strong></li></p><p></ul></p><p>Before you start thinking that I've succumbed to magical thinking, bear with me.</p><p></p><p>Humans are, insofar as we are aware, the only creatures in the universe capable of abstract thought -- or, let me rephrase that, capable of <em>thinking abstract thoughts</em>, which is more precise. We are also the only creatures capable of making things up -- of imagination and lying. This may seem obvious, but it's not, because imagination and lying are things that don't make sense from a purely physical standpoint.</p><p></p><p>It can be argued that there is a strong evolutionary value to imagination: if one can create inside of one's head a small model of the world in which one can try out certain actions -- what will happen if I try to jump into this river to chase this tasty deer, or what will happen if I were to jump off of this cliff -- one can avoid a great deal of trouble and, therefore, ensure survival. It seems like an odd thing to have evolved, though -- aside from humans, Nature always tends to favor external, physical survival traits rather than mental ones. But maybe it was imagination, first and foremost, that kept our frail species alive in a hostile world.</p><p></p><p>Here's an experiment: right now, I want you to imagine an urban place you've never been -- let's say, in my case, Red Square in Moscow. Just imagine yourself standing in the middle of this place, looking at the buildings, the people around you, the sky. Can you do that?</p><p></p><p>Okay, good. I know you can, because almost all humans can. Hold on to that scene, in your mind, for a moment.</p><p></p><p>In computer graphics, you hear the term <em>resolution</em> used a lot. Resolution is the word we use to describe the number of pixels in an image or display, or how many pixels a sensor (such as a digital camera's sensor) can take in at once. You hear the terms <em>high-resolution</em> and <em>low-resolution </em>used a lot; essentially, they refer to the ratio of number of pixels in a given area of a graphic input or output device. Hi-res images have higher ratios; for example, part of how we measure the quality of printer is in how many dots per inch (DPI) or pixels per inch (PPI) it can reproduce. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_4#Display\">Up until recently</a>, printers were three to four times higher resolution than computer monitors (an average of 200-300 dpi for printers vs. 72-96 dpi for screens), which is why most people still prefer to read print off of paper rather than a screen: it's sharper and more detailed on paper.</p><p></p><p>Resolution can also be used as a measurement of fidelity. A \"lo-res\" copy of an image is in fact a simplified approximation of that image. Take for example, these two images of the Mona Lisa.</p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p><p></p><p>[caption id=\"attachment_1522\" align=\"aligncenter\"  caption=\"Two versions of the Mona Lisa. Both are recognizable, but the image on the left is much lower-resolution. Even the image on the right is an approximation, though.\"]<a href=\"http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/monalisa.jpg\"><img title=\"monalisa\" src=\"http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/monalisa-300x214.jpg\" /></a>[/caption]</p><p></p><p></p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Both of these are relatively low-resolution reproductions of the Mona Lisa, one more obvious than the other, even though both are recognizable <em>as</em> Da Vinci's famous painting. To  your perception, the image on the right looks more \"realistic\" -- or higher resolution -- but in fact both images are simply approximations.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">There's a famous story about Picasso at a dinner party, where a fellow guest asked him why he didn't paint \"realistic\" art. Picasso asked the man if he had a picture of his wife in his wallet. The man did, and produced it. Picasso looked at it for a moment and remarked \"She's rather small, isn't she? And flat?\"</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A wallet picture is an approximation of an actual person -- a rather small and flat one. So are the images above small, flat approximations of the Mona Lisa. A <em>perfect</em> replica of the Mona Lisa would be a replica which reproduced the original painting down to the arrangement of the atoms in the molecules of paint on the canvas. Of course, at that level of precision -- of <em>resolution </em>-- the \"replica\" would be absolutely identical to the original. There would be no difference. Even the most exacting and skilled of art experts could not tell them apart.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">(We're not even going to get into the fact that the Mona Lisa itself is a simulation of some still-unknown woman --or perhaps a gender-bent portrait of the artist himself -- a projection of a three-dimensional person projected onto a two-dimensional canvas.)</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Let's not use the word \"replica\" anymore, though. Let's use the word \"simulation\", which is defined as \"the act of imitating the behavior of some situation or some process by means of something suitably analogous\". One example would be a flight simulator, which imitates the behavior of an airplane in flight. Many pilots train on flight simulators before they ever actually take a real plane into the sky, because no matter how realistic, how <em>hi-resolution</em> the simulator is, it ignores one aspect of flying a plane entirely: namely, it will not hurt or kill you and damage or destroy your aircraft if you fail to land properly.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But a simulation doesn't have to necessarily be of an <em>actual</em> situation or process to be <em>realistic</em>. Video games are simulations of realities, simplified and abstracted and occasionally tweaked away from \"real\" reality whilst maintaining a certain internal consistency.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">For example: <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> is a simulation of an Italian-American plumber wandering through a colorful world killing antagonists who try to harm him or impede his quest to find the Princess. It is not a realistic simulation. Mario is rather small, and flat, and were he mapped onto the real world he would consist of pixelated blocks and unnatural colors. Likewise, he is capable of utterly impossible feats, such as jumping several times his own height into the air from a standstill, gaining the ability to store and launch fireballs at will, and to instantly double his own height by eating a mushroom slightly larger than he is. He fights creatures that are physically impossible -- flying turtles, animated mushrooms with angry human eyes, living bullets. <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> is not a high-resolution simulation at all.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Contrast that with a more recent game such as <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, which got a lot of positive press last year. <em>RDR</em> is a far more realistic simulation than <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> in every sense -- visually, sonically, and even in regards to the physics of the tiny universe it contains and the behavior of the non-player-characters. It is easier to suspend your disbelief when playing <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, despite the fact that you are controlling an apparently normal human being's behavior via a plastic thingy with buttons in your hand, sitting in your living room. You can lose yourself in its depiction of the American West, in all its glory and grandeur.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And yet, it is still, in comparison to the reality we inhabit, very small. And flat. And unrealistic in other ways -- in our world, when someone gets shot with more than one bullet at once, they almost always die. And when they die, they're dead forever; no save point.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The late Jean Baudrillard made the majority of his career as a postmodern philosopher and media critic off the notion of \"hyperreality\", which he defined as \"a simulation of reality without basis in fact\". <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> is a hyperreality: it simulates a world that does not, never did and never could exist. Of course, so does <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>: but the \"hyper\" part of its hyperreality is a little more subdued, a little less glaring.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Had Rockstar Games, maker of <em>RDR</em>, wanted to make a <em>perfect</em> simulation of the late 19th century American West, they would have replicated all of, say, Arizona down to the molecule, including the humans who inhabited it. These \"simulated\" people in this simulated world would, presumably, behave exactly like real people, because the processes that allowed them to exist would be at least as complex as those of \"real\" people in the \"real\" world.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Ignoring the practical impossibility of this for a moment, let's say that Rockstar <em>did </em>somehow accomplish this superhuman feat. How would they store the game's data, if it was a precise replica of Arizona circa 1875 or so? They'd be storing the position of every atom in that space -- hell, every <em>electron</em> in every atom in that space. It would require at <em>least</em> as many actual electrons to describe the simulation <em>as there were in the actual thing it was simulating</em>. Like our Mona Lisa, the map would, in essence, become the territory.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Of course, Rockstar could compress the size of their simulation a bit by leaving out the bits that a player would never encounter, such as impassable mountain tops and the bottom of deep lakes, places a \"player\" could never experience. They could also reduce the amount of information stored -- reuse the same grain of sand over and over again, rather than having each grain of sand be its own unique, discrete self. You could probably shave several thousand petabytes of data off in this way before even the most observant player began to notice.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But in doing so, your simulation would suffer a loss of resolution. The player might not know, but <em>you'd</em> know. And if you ran the simulation long enough, it would begin to behave in unrealistic ways. Soil erosion would work differently if every grain of sand were physically identical down to the atomic structure. After a year, or ten, or ten thousand, your simulation would not only not be identical to the real world it was simulating, it would be <em>wildly</em> different.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Which brings us back to our imaginary urban scene. I told you we'd come back to this.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Pull it up again in your mind. Picture the scene, imagine the sounds and scents around you. Look at the faces of the people in your scene. Notice what they're wearing, how their eyes are shaped, how tall or short each one is.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">What you are doing is creating a hyperreal simulation within your own head of a place you've never been. The picture of Red Square in my head is probably wildly inaccurate, as it's mainly based on a few dozen 1980s Cold War-era movies. But though it might be imprecise in its level of resolution, it's still at least as high-resolution as <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>'s simulation of the Wild West, if not much more so. I can smell coal smoke in the air -- I don't know if Red Square really smells like coal smoke, but the places I've been that are similar in Turkey and Eastern Europe always did. I can picture the people -- people I've never seen before, who don't exist in real life. I can see the sky, clear blue even on a cold day. I can see the breath coming out of my own mouth as condensation, drifting and fading away.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The human brain is not a computer, but it shares one very important attribute with a computer: it is a <em>real thing</em>. It consists of atoms and electromagnetic patterns, which are -- ultimately -- the same thing when you get right down to it. And everything in it, everything it does, happens in the real world. What we call a \"calculation\" in a computer is the process of electrons flowing through silicon circuitry, bouncing this way and that through logic gates. The term \"calculation\" is an abstraction of a real process.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In the same way, what we call a \"thought\" is an actual, physical event within our brains. It's some as-yet unknown combination of electrical and physical activity happening in the incredibly complex labyrinth within our skulls. We don't understand it, but we understand that it is a <em>real</em> thing, a material object/event in a material world. <em>Thoughts are not abstractions.</em></p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em></em>Let me repeat that, because it is absolutely vital.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Thoughts are not abstractions. Thoughts are things. Real things.</em></p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em></em>When you imagine Red Square or wherever you chose to imagine, that simulation of reality exists as a physical pattern of logic gates or electrons or whatever the case may be within your brain, the same way the world of <em>Super Mario Bros</em> exists as a series of instructions hard-coded onto a Nintendo RAM cartridge. <em>It exists. It is real, </em>the same way your notional Red Square or Alexanderplatz or Santa Monica Pier in your head is real; it takes up a finite number of electrons inside your head.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The electrons in your head aren't a perfect miniature replica of Red Square, of course; if I were to hack the top of your skull off, I wouldn't see a miniature Kremlin hiding in there, anymore than if you tore open a <em>Super Mario Bros</em> cartridge you'd see a perfect little Koopa Kingdom hiding inside the gray plastic. It's an abstraction of a real place; your brain builds it from instructions and fills in the redundancies and the gaps the same way a Nintendo console takes the binary data encoded within that cartridge and builds a tiny Day-Glo world from it.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The most fascinating part of this, to me, is the fact that your brain has constructed a realistic model of a place that, if you were following my instructions, <em>you've never been</em>. Again, my Red Square may not be a precise simulation of the <em>real</em> Red Square, but it exists at a similar resolution, follows the same rules. I can walk, in my mind, into any corner of it and inspect it, look at the cracks in the cobblestones, see the grass struggling to grow there. I can replicate the color of the grass with the color picker in Adobe Photoshop and show it to you. If I were a better draftsman, I could <em>draw</em> you my Red Square, from any angle you liked. I have never been there, but in my head there's a Red Square at least as believable as the real one.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Every imaginary place is real, in the sense that it exists in some abstracted form within the real world.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The lands of Middle-Earth began as a structure of synaptic connections in the mind of J.R.R. Tolkien; he put them down onto pressed, bleached sheets of wood pulp with ink and abstracted them in a different way. You read the words, and in your mind is your <em>own</em> Middle-Earth. It's not precisely the Middle-Earth that Tolkien was thinking of, maybe; in your mind, Gandalf the Gray may look to you like Sir Ian McKellen, who played him in Peter Jackson's film adaptations of Tolkien's books; as Gandalf first appeared in <em>The Hobbit</em>, published two years before McKellen was born, I suspect he didn't look that way to Tolkien. To someone else who's never seen the films, Gandalf may look in their minds like their grandfather, or Sean Connery, or no one real at all. And yet, if I showed you <em>my</em> internal vision of Gandalf and you showed me yours, we'd probably recognize them as the same person that Tolkien describes: \"...an old man with a staff. He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which a white beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots.<em>\" </em>We do this every Hallowe'en: your friend may look nothing like Ian McKellen or Sean Connery or your grandfather, but when he walks into the party in the blue hat and gray cloak and white beard, you <em>know</em> instantly that he's Gandalf. He doesn't have to explain himself; indeed, his costume is considered less effective if he does.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In other words, you and I would be able to recognize one man pretending to be another man <em>who never existed</em>. Because humans are capable of inventing people who don't exist, and worlds for them to live in, and we are capable of replicating those worlds -- those thoughts, those electrical patterns in our heads -- to one another by converting them into patterns of sound (speech) or marks on a page (writing) or the selective exposure to light of celluloid (film). Tolkien is long dead, but in the same way that his DNA is literally still extant in his children and grandchildren, the patterns of electrical impulse in his long-decayed brain are still literally extant, in slightly modified form, in almost any bookstore you'd care to walk into in any city on the Earth.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The point of all of this is that humans can create worlds that are larger on the inside than the outside, like Doctor Who's famed TARDIS; that our thoughts are literally part of the material world and can effect change within it; and that we can nest internally consistent realities within one another. Inside every book and every video game and every movie is a compressed reality, your brain is the tool that uncompresses it and fills in the blanks.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">So what <em>else</em> can the human brain do within the framework of a rational, material universe?</p></p>",

                "content": "<p>I'm currently working on a nasty horror short story for my friend Jarret Keene's upcoming anthology of Las Vegas horror stories. When I write, I listen to music; generally instrumental stuff. When I'm doing horror, I tend to listen to a lot of post-rock stuff like Mogwai (the track \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLFd6k1BHDk\">Auto Rock</a>\" being a favorite), as well as hauntological electronic like Burial, and random film soundtracks, my favorite being Cliff Martinez's score for <em>Solaris</em> and Clint Mansell's <em>Requiem For A Dream</em>, as well as Lisa Gerrard and Peter Bourke's <a href=\"http://www.tracksounds.com/reviews/insider.htm\">lovely score for <em>The Insider</em></a>.</p><p></p><p>However, I find that I run into a problem: the music runs out or changes moods long before I want it to. It might take me three hours to write a scene, and unless I'm looping a single track or album again and again (which, in and of itself, is tiresome) I'm going to lose the feeling of the music long before I'm done writing.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday, I hit upon a novel solution: I fired up Ableton Live and used some of my techniques for generating algorithmic music to create an evolving, unending \"soundtrack\" to listen to while writing a scene. It took me about ten minutes to throw together an appropriate set of sounds, rhythms, loops and harmonies...and I left it running for the three hours it took to write the climactic scene of my short story. (When I popped over to it and closed it, it was running to something like 1300 measures.)</p><p></p><p>It worked perfectly! One long song, with enough variation not to sound like a loop, maintaining the creepy feeling I wanted while I wrote this horrible scene. (It involves a drugged Russian prostitute and a Lovecraftian beastie.) I think I'll try it for all of my writing projects from here on out.</p><p></p><p>If you're curious, here's a 32-measure sample of the music.</p><p></p><p>[audio:http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Shokushu-Goukan-excerpt.mp3|titles=Theme from \"Shokushu Goukan\" (excerpt)]</p>",

                "content": "<p><img style=\"margin: 10px;\" title=\"HIPSTERS\" src=\"http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/HIPSTERS-214x300.jpg\" />As anybody who's ever heard a musical note knows, tiny Muenster, Texas (pop. 1566) has become the new indie hotbed. Muenster bands such as Punky Brewster Soundsystem and Lars And His Horse People were the bands to watch at SxSW this year, not to mention Helsinki's IceeBalls Music Showcase and Rumpster Magazine's Provo-based RumpFest. Raconteurs frontman Jack White has recently announced that he's opening a vintage 8-track store and BBQ shack in downtown Muenster, just another example of the town's growing cultural capital. And, of course, there's Crystal Wolf Loves Foxes Too, who seem poised to become Muenster's Next Big Thing.</p><p></p><p>CWLFT is the brainchild of nineteen year old Ryan Dylan Ryan and his eighteen year old sister Brionna Jennee Ryan. Beginning in 2008 as a Christian indie folk duo influenced by Devendra Banhart and Loggins &amp; Messina, in just three short years their sound has matured, mixing elements of the Arcade Fire's post-ironic dreariness and the lush electro sounds of El DeBarge with the neo-folk of Mumford &amp; Sons and the undefinable quintessence of Fleet Foxes, whose name inspired one of the words in CWLFT's own name.</p><p></p><p>\"We started out doing worship music,\" says Ryan Dylan Ryan, who refuses to do any press unless his name is printed in full every time it's mentioned, \"but after a while I realized that I had my own, like, musical path to follow. Plus people kept calling me 'Jesus queer' and punching me in the kidney every time we did a show at the roller rink.\"</p><p></p><p>After purchasing a 1989-vintage Roland CR-69 drum machine from a neighbor with special needs who had previously used the device to communicate with his elderly parents, Ryan Dylan Ryan recruited his sister Brionna Jennee Ryan on hurdy-gurdy, tenor banjo and backup vocals. \"I'm not really sure what Brionna was doing musically before that,\" Ryan Dylan Ryan says. \"I know she sucked a guy's dick behind the rec center this one time so she could afford to drive to Dallas and see Someone Loves You Boris Yeltsen, so I guess you could say she's always had this musical obsession.\"</p><p></p><p>Brionna Jennee Ryan (who credits her unique fashion sense to her incipient fetal alcohol syndrome) prefers to avoid the limelight -- and, in fact, according to her brother, light altogether. \"Yeah, she was born with this weird allergy to light,\" says Ryan Dylan Ryan, \"so she never comes out unless we're playing a gig. I don't actually even, like, know where she lives or anything. We rehearse in this old abandoned nuclear missile silo that these organic farmers are turning into a massive grow station, but we have to turn off the UV lights or Brionna will start projectile vomiting and stuff.\" Ryan Dylan Ryan credits his sister's delicate, sunny pop-perfect arrangements to the fact that she was born without a lower brain stem or tongue. \"She's so real, you know? She doesn't like worry about all the bullshit like other people. She just sits in the dark with her hurdy-gurdy and her Brian Wilson records and just, like, makes art and stuff. And hoots.\"</p><p></p><p>Despite being courted by Williamsburg indie darling label Swollen Coke Fork Records, Crystal Wolf Loves Foxes Too refuses to leave Muenster. \"We've got our roots here,\" says Ryan Dylan Ryan. \"In Brionna's case, that's totally literal, by the way.\" They chose to release their first album, <em>I Heard Somebody Crying And Then I Realized It Was Me</em>, through Internet channels only, though a limited edition -- carved into an Edison wax cylinder and wrapped in a Palestinian <em>keffiyeh</em> scarf -- is available via mail order and through a special distribution deal with the Luby's chain of affordable cafeterias, a move that Ryan Dylan Ryan describes as \"thinking outside the Old Media box\".</p><p></p><p>The album -- co-produced, like every other fucking indie rock album ever, by Steve Albini and Sonic Youth's Lee Renaldo -- is a curious mix of tender, heartfelt white people singing, reminiscent of Portland's You Don't Bring Your Mother and Bright Eyes, and dissonant electronica that one reviewer notoriously described as \"sounding like Aphex Twin taking a violent shit at a truckstop in El Paso\".</p><p></p><p>\"We slept in Albini's studio while we were making the record,\" says Ryan Dylan Ryan. \"Only he didn't know about it. He's so funny -- he'd walk around going 'Why does my vocal booth smell like a sheep shit in it?' and 'Why doesn't that albino whore have an indented nasal bridge like a normal human?'\"</p><p></p><p>Critical success has come quickly for Crystal Wolf Loves Foxes Too, as well as a certain amount of underground fame. Ryan Dylan Ryan won't discuss rumors that he's currently in a relationship with Rilo Kiley's Jenny Lewis, but statistics and the law of averages suggests that he probably is. Meanwhile, Brionna Jennee Ryan has been seen doing high profile DJ gigs at vegan collectives in northern Sweden during the long, sunless winter months, and is recording a collaboration with Karin Dreijer Andersson of Fever Ray to be entitled either <em>Ah, Fuck, The Goddamn Weasels Are Tearing At Our Clits Again</em> or simply <em>Eeeeeeeaaaaauuuugh</em>, which reportedly uses no instruments other than the sounds of Andersson and Ryan banging their skulls against moss-covered Icelandic cliff faces and weeping. \"I've heard it,\" says Ryan Dylan Ryan, \"and it's a totally challenging record. But it's like, totally sunny and pop-perfect and danceable too.\"</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the mainstream world keeps calling too. Recently director Noah Baumbach used the CWLFT song \"Thundercats Ho\" in his indie drama <em>Melvin, His Trust Fund And His Bicycle</em>, which also features tracks from Cut Fleet Cold Furnaces, You Don't Bring Your Mother, Hey Look It's Lisa Bonet From The Cosby Show and Beck. Another track from <em>I Heard Somebody Crying And Then I Realized It Was Me</em> was used in a television ad for Same Ol' Hootenanny Moustache Wax. \"I mean, I guess it probably looks like we're selling out,\" says Ryan Dylan Ryan, \"but it's hard to live without money. Plus somebody, I'm not gonna say who, but somebody in the band needed a tail removal operation, and they don't do that for free in Texas.\"</p><p></p><p>So what's next for Crystal Wolf Loves Foxes Too? Ryan Dylan Ryan says the band's just taking it easy and preparing to go into the studio to record their sophomore album, tentatively titled <em>Fuck I Wish It Was 1988</em>, which is rumored to be produced by the Arcade Fire's Win Butler. \"I called Win up one day,\" says Ryan Dylan Ryan, \"and asked him if he'd produce the album, and he said he would if he could fly down to Muenster and give me a Brazilian. I started laughing, but he was totally serious. I mean, dude, what would you do? It's totally the guy from Arcade Fire? So he flew down and we went out in a cornfield and he gave me a wax. His wife filmed it with an 8mm film camera, but I haven't seen it on, like, their website or anything yet, so maybe when they do a DVD or something.\" The album is apparently a radical departure from the band's current sound, featuring sunny, pop-perfect vocals over rootsy alt-country rather than shimmery alt-folk. \"We've got one track, which I think is going to be called 'Trapper Keeper Yay You're So Rad', and we've got like seven hundred and thirty vocal harmony tracks,\" says Ryan Dylan Ryan. \"Most of them are by Grizzly Bear, but I got my neighbor who sold me this drum machine one time to sing some of them, except he couldn't remember the lyrics, so he just sang about Huey Long and the fascist takeover of Louisiana, but it's like way more organic that way, you know?\"</p><p></p><p>One thing's for sure: Crystal Wolf Loves Foxes Too is the band to watch out for, for at least the next seven or eight minutes.</p>",

            "source": {
                "content": "<p>Dear Representative Berkley,</p><p></p><p>My name is Joshua Ellis. I'm a writer and web developer from Las Vegas. You may or may not know who I am -- I was a opinion columnist for many years for the Las Vegas CityLife and I'm also somewhat well-known for co-authoring a series of articles about the homeless people living in the storm drains under Las Vegas.</p><p></p><p>I'm writing you because I understand that the current budget proposal submitted by the Republican factions in Congress which completely removes the $430 million budget for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting System (PBS) network of television channels.</p><p></p><p>Representative Berkley, I sincerely hope you agree with me that this is a deeply disturbing and ludicrous proposal. The value of NPR and PBS in both childhood and adult education is immeasurable; I imagine that like me and my wife and my five-year-old sister, your children grew up learning about the world via the irreplaceable magic of TV series like <em>Sesame Street</em> and <em>The Electric Company</em>; and perhaps your family, like mine, enjoy and benefit from programs like <em>Nova</em> and the late Carl Sagan's <em>Cosmos</em>, as well as radio programs like <em>This American Life</em> and <em>All Things Considered</em>.</p><p></p><p>NPR and PBS serve an important role in American media: by being funded by the people -- unlike commercial media outlets -- they are not subject to the whims of advertisers or subscribers. (While it is true that corporations and other commercial outlets often sponsor NPR and PBS programming, it is my understanding that they have no editorial say over that programming.) By removing public funding, CPB will become simply another television network like ABC or CBS, controlled by the people who hold the purse strings...or, even worse, it will simply be commercially unviable and cease programming altogether. That, I believe, would be a terribly tragedy for the American people.</p><p></p><p>Fiscal conservatives often quote President Coolidge's statement that the business of government is business. I disagree. The government of the United States is not a widget factory or a retail outlet, despite every attempt by PACs and SIGs to the contrary. The business of the government is to serve the needs of the citizens -- all of the citizens, not merely the ones who write the biggest checks.</p><p></p><p>I'm sure you'll agree with me, Representative Berkley, that it is not your job to turn a profit. You are not some shabby little accountant. Your job is to do what's best for the people of your district and, in a broader sense, the American people in general. Part of that, I believe, is recognizing that there are certain things that the federal government puts money into with no expectation of a monetary return on investment. When it comes to public media, the return on investment can be measured by looking at the face of every man, woman and child whose world is expanded by the programming therein.</p><p></p><p>When children watch commercial programming, they learn that the most important thing in the world is to buy whatever toy the network is hawking during this particular half-hour, that it's important to pay lip-service to individuality, but that it's more important to conform. They are taught to be nothing more than good consumers.</p><p></p><p>When children watch <em>Sesame Street</em> and other public media programming, they learn to count, to use their language, to think critically, to share with others, to value peace and comfort, that people who look and speak differently than they do are friends, not enemies. They learn that the world is a huge and amazing place, and they learn that they are capable of doing whatever they dream of in that world.</p><p></p><p>In that sense, our investment in public media is really an investment in our future; in building a future America that is not full of bright, capable, curious, pro-active citizens.</p><p></p><p>It is, in other words, priceless.</p><p></p><p>And so I hope, Representative Berkeley that you will vote against the cutting of public media funding from this new budget. (Not to mention the cutting of library and educational funding, of course, but I don't feel that's even worth discussing; any representative of the people who believes in reducing library funding is a dangerous scoundrel.)</p><p></p><p>By doing so, you will display that you possess much farther vision than many of your peers; you will be making an investment that will pay off millions of times over in the long term of America's future. And you will be, as the theme to <em>The Electric Company</em> used to say when I was a kid, helping to bring the power to the people who desperately need it.</p><p></p><p>Thank you for your time.</p><p></p><p>All my best,Joshua Ellis</p>",

I'm bored with shiny, happy, sun-kissed music, with Brian Wilson fetishism, with ELO close harmonies and layers of major key Mellotron. I'm bored with beardo indie pop. I'm bored with Prozac music, blissed out \"happy\" music that actually has no passion behind it. I'm sick of danceability, of 8-bit synths, of the almost hysterical infantilism of most modern rock and roll.</p><p></p><p>I grew up in the 1980s. I love much of the music of the 1980s. I have absolutely no fucking desire whatsoever to attempt to replicate it as closely as possible, down to spending thousands of dollars buying really shitty \"vintage\" digital synthesizers that are easily and precisely replicable on any device with more complexity than a ten year old Nokia candybar cell phone. (Trust me on this; you can <em>exactly</em> replicate a TR-808 drum machine or Yamaha DX-7 synth in software now. There's no magic in them, no secret ingredients, not even the random variation of a 1970s analog synth.)</p><p></p><p>I want to make music for unhappy people. I want to make music for sexually frustrated people. I want to make music for losers, geeks, freaks, drunks, addicts, burnouts. I want to make music that people will sit in the dark and listen to and burn incense and smoke cigarettes, and I want the music I make to maybe stop them from hurting quite so much. I want to make rough music. I want to make glitchy music. I want to mix the sounds of electronic music, which I love, with the emotional intensity of rock and roll. I want to make music for adults with adult emotions, ambiguous and not always beautiful. I want to make music that drones, that has beats, that makes you want to go out and fuck or kill or die or live. I want to make music that pretty people hear and get aneurysms and fall down dead on the street. I don't want to be experimental, because making atonal horrible noise isn't experimental. A lot of people already tried the experiments and produced a lot of pompous, shitty records.</p><p></p><p>I want to make a record, not a collection of singles for YouTube. I want to make videos, but I want them to be interesting, otherwise there's no point.</p><p></p><p>Fuck Brian Wilson. Fuck Jeff Lynne. Fuck the Arcade Fire. My music is influenced by: William Gibson, Lorca, Clive Barker, T.S. Eliot, Anne Sexton, Tom Waits, Lou Reed, Tricky, Garth Ennis, Hunter Thompson, Neil Gaiman, Van Morrison, The National, Grant Morrison, China Mieville, Dave McKean, Nick Drake, Sant'Elia, Bowie, Harlan Ellison, Nick Cave, Jon Hassell, Brian Eno, Leonard Cohen, Leonard Cohen, Leonard Cohen. My music is influenced by all the horrible nights I spent drunk hurting myself and all the terrible things I've done and all the redemption I've managed to scrape together. My music is influenced by every pack of cigarettes I've smoked and every tab of acid I've chewed on and all the good sex and bad sex I've had and every shit bar I've ever been in and every beautiful salon and not at all by wonderful white suburbia. I don't give a fuck about the lives of suburbanites unless they go mad.</p><p></p><p>I can't sing. I don't care anymore. I sing the way I sing. I write better songs than people who sing better than I do. My music isn't complex. It doesn't have the kind of chord changes that other musicians get excited by. I don't care. I'll write songs with two notes.</p><p></p><p>Lyrics matter. If you don't think so, you're doing it wrong.</p><p></p><p>I want to write songs that make people want to sell everything they own and get on a plane and disappear into the world, born again under wilder skies. I want people to fuck to my music. I want people to want my songs played on a boombox at their graveside. I want to make people happy. I want to make people think</p><p></p><p>I don't need to rock harder than anybody else. I'm a pussy. I write gloomy mid-tempo music. That's fine. I make gloomy mid-tempo music as hard as I fucking can. It's not made to drop in the club to help morons find other morons to fuck. I want smart people fucking to my music.</p><p></p><p>I don't care if anyone else likes my music anymore, or buys it. If you don't like it, it's not for you. Maybe in a hundred years, somebody will dig it. Maybe you dig it now. If you do, I'm glad. Really glad.</p><p></p><p>I will never be on the cover of a glossy magazine. Prom queens will never want to meet me because my music speaks to them. Nobody will ever ask me to do a celebrity remix. Nobody will ever put my music over the closing credits of a blockbuster movie. That's fine. I don't care.</p><p></p><p>Every song I record, every record I make, is a paper boat with a candle in it, set onto a wine-dark sea and sent off into the world. I don't know where they will end up. I hope interesting and crazy and maybe useful places. But it doesn't matter, in the end. All that matters is that I make them and set them free, until the day I die.</p><p></p><p>Anything else would be pathetic.</p>",

This has two benefits: 1) it's nearly impossible for your hand to slip off the knife handle and onto the blade, sparing you the possibility of stitches and a hospital trip, and 2) allowing you to hold the knife and your hand in a far more natural position while cutting.

                "content": "<p>So I've got a smoked black bean soup on the stove cooking right now, and I thought I'd drop some of my totally anecdotal cooking science on you.</p><p></p><p>I'm an improvisational cook; I tend to make recipes based on what I have in the kitchen, rather than buying ingredients to make specific dishes. Because of this, I tend to keep my pantry stocked with certain items which end up getting used in lots of different things. To wit:</p><p></p><p><strong>• <em>Tomato puree and tomato paste.</em></strong> This is essential. Tomatoes are the base in almost every non-Chinese or Japanese dish I make. I know lots of cooks are snobs about their tomatoes (\"I buy twenty pounds of tomatoes and boil them into sauce over a 48 hour period!\") but you and I live in the real world, or at least I do, and I can't afford to buy fucking organic tomatoes in bulk and let them cook down like I'm some kind of goddamn Sicilian <em>materfamilias</em>.</p><p></p><p>Buy big cans and lots of them, they're cheap. I never buy less than four 24 oz. cans of tomato puree when I go to the store and I almost always use them up by the time I go back. The paste is good for thickening soups and sauces and for more robust dishes.</p><p></p><p><strong>• <em>Black beans.</em></strong> Almost as versatile as tomatoes. I use them in lieu of meat in everything from chili to Mediterranean dishes. Plus you can mix them with bread crumbs and egg and make veggie burger patties.</p><p></p><p><strong>• </strong><em><strong>Balsamic vinegar</strong>.</em> Balsamic vinegar is the Auto-Tune of cooking. It can make almost anything taste not entirely shitty. Red wine vinegar is fine too, if you don't mind looking like a big pussy.</p><p></p><p><strong>• <em>Olive oil.</em></strong> I use olive oil almost exclusively except for deep-frying, where it's not financially feasible. If you're really stuck for a dish, boil some pasta and throw some olive oil and balsamic vinegar over it with a few veggies.</p><p></p><p><strong>• <em>Garlic.</em></strong> Garlic is non-negotiable. Everything has fucking garlic in it.</p><p></p><p><strong>• <em>Beef and chicken broth</em>.</strong> Unless you're vegan, in which case you shouldn't ever listen to my cooking advice ever.</p><p></p><p><strong>• <em>A package of chicken breasts</em></strong>. Fresh are nice, but again, we live in the real world; I buy the Wal-Mart bags, three pounds of boneless skinless chicken breasts for about $7, and thaw 'em a couple of hours before I use 'em. I have razor-sharp cooking knives, so I can chop them even if they're still mostly frozen...which comes in handy if you're making something where you want to cube your chicken or slice it into actual strips instead of mushy creepy-looking tendrils.</p><p></p><p><strong>• <em>Basil, oregano, parsley</em></strong>. My holy trinity. The wife is allergic to thyme so I don't use it, but I make up for it a lot with fresh rosemary from the bush out front of our house.</p><p></p><p><strong>• <em>Cumin</em>.</strong> Cumin is a big ingredient in both Spanish/Mexican/Tex-Mex-style dishes and in Indian food. I go through more cumin than any other spice.</p><p></p><p>I also tend to use a lot of onions and mushrooms in my cooking, but that's a personal choice.</p><p></p><p>Cooking isn't about slavishly following recipes: it's about getting a feel for what tastes good with what. I don't give a shit about cultural accuracy in my cooking: I'll mix up anything that tastes rad together. Call it \"fusion\" if you like. For example, I once made a really awesome jambalaya using Louisiana hot links and frozen chunks of mango that I dredged in salt and pepper (after getting the idea from an MIA lyric). Fucking awesome.</p><p></p><p>If you know how to make a basic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirepoix_(cuisine)\">soffritto/mirepoix</a>, the basic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauce#Sauces_in_French_cuisine\">mother sauces</a>, and how to properly cook meat to keep it moist (hint: fast and hot), you're set. Everything from there is just riffing on combinations of flavor and texture. I like combinations of sweet and <em>umami</em> or savory, personally, and I like my food rich and spicy. So I keep several kinds of salt; not the flavored sea salt shit yuppies buy from Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, but celery salt and seasoned salt and plain ol' sea salt for crunchy texture. I have Crystal and Srirachi and Cholula hot sauce at the ready.</p><p></p><p>Note: this is mostly for stove cooking. I can't bake worth a shit. I'm horrible at it. But I can walk into your kitchen and make something awesome out of whatever you happen to have.</p><p></p><p>I fail a lot and make weird shit; the other night I tried to make a Burgundy sauce for veggie burgers and ended up with a sort of hideous wine gravy that was completely inedible, mainly by adding too much flour to the mix. But there's no such thing as failure in cooking...merely lessons to be learned.</p><p></p><p>Now, if I can just figure out what the fuck to do with tofu....</p>",

                "content": "<p>Just wrote a long letter to a family friend asking for advice on raising a small bit of money to keep me afloat until I can finish Stikki.me. Now it's 3 am and I'm sitting here, spooked, and hoping the power company will let me make payments before shutting off the lights.</p><p></p><p>I've thought about going the Kickstarter/IndieGoGo route again the way I did with Dbasr, but I feel weird about it. I haven't abandoned Dbasr, not by a long shot, but it was just too much work for me to do by myself without having enough money to pay the bills. All the code is sitting there waiting to get picked up again. I started playing with Stikki as a way to earn money to work on Dbasr, and that's still very much the plan. But I'm afraid people just think I took the money and did nothing with it -- which is, of course, not true. I've busted my <em>ass</em> on Dbasr, the way I've busted ass on Stikki. I am grateful for the support I got. It just wasn't enough to devote myself full-time to finishing that project yet.</p><p></p><p>I feel really guilty about that, actually. But you can ask my wife  -- there were times I worked on Dbasr for literally twenty-four hours straight without sleep, and I do almost the same with Stikki. But I'm not a trust fund kid and I don't have any financial reserves. When the bills come due, I have to stop working on these things and find paying work, and it's hard to balance paying and personal work, especially when you're just married. When I was 21 I probably could have just done an eight hour gig and then holed up and written code until I passed out, but I can't do that now. I barely sleep as it is; I usually go to bed around four or five am and wake up around ten thirty. And I think Rosalie enjoys it when I occasionally pop my head up and actually interact with her and acknowledge her existence, instead of simply staring at the laptop and muttering darkly about APIs and MVC framework. She also enjoys it when I take showers and shave instead of rolling out of bed and onto the computer.</p><p></p><p>(In fact, I think the combination of poor hygiene, the stream of swearing about apparent gibberish like \"JOIN queries\" and \"consumer keys\" and the straggly beard makes me resemble nothing so much as a random crazy street person, except I have a laptop instead of a shopping cart. Which is no good for Rosalie's nerves, I know.)</p><p></p><p>I just keep hoping if I work and work and work I'll get Stikki finished and money will start coming in. But the last two weeks have fucked me. I couldn't work, thanks to first the anxiety attacks and then the Xanax zombiedom from trying to chemically defuse the anxiety attacks. I don't have any money left. I've been eyeing my guitars, trying to figure out if I could pawn them for enough to pay the power bills. (Short answer: no. They're not exactly high-end musical instruments.) I need to work on the two paying projects I've got right now basically for sixteen hours a day until the end of the month to barely cover our rent. Which also does my anxiety problem no good, nor does it particularly please my wife.</p><p></p><p>The worst thing about all of this is that I am absolutely, utterly convinced that I can make Stikki profitable enough to be happy. I've done the math, and unless I am staggeringly stupid I can earn enough from advertising to pay the bills within just a couple of months. I can <em>see</em> the Promised Land, where you don't sit up at three am worrying about bills. I just can't reach it.</p><p></p><p>Feel free to ignore this, by the way, and if I sound like I'm whining, well, yeah, I probably am. I'm just tired, and I need help and I don't know where to find it or even how to ask.</p><p></p><p>I'm going to go to bed and try to finish the last Harry Potter novel now.</p>",

                "content": "<p>So I've been under the weather recently.</p><p></p><p>About two weeks ago, I started having a weird sensation in my chest. It felt like my heart was leaping, the way it does when you go over the curve on a rollercoaster or get startled. My heart would do a strange <em>thump</em> and it would be as if my breath were slightly knocked out of me for a second. It made me feel really weak. No, truth be told, every time it happened, it felt like I was about to keel over and die.</p><p></p><p>As an overweight man who smokes like a chimney and whose exercise mainly consists of hauling his fat ass and a big laptop bag from home to one of two nearby coffee shops, I was rather concerned, as you might imagine. I ignored it for about three days, and then Rosalie insisted I go to the doctor. So we went to a local cheap clinic, where a nurse put an EKG on me for about sixty seconds before disappearing for forty-five minutes. Finally a doctor showed up with a laptop in his hand, where he -- I kid you not -- appeared to be Googling my symptoms.</p><p></p><p>He told me it was heart palpitations and not to worry about it, that 50% of the population gets them at some time in their lives and that it wasn't a big deal. He told me it was basically a slowed-down panic attack, caused by stress and anxiety. He told me to stop drinking five big coffees every day. That was it. (Except for discovering that I've managed to lower my blood pressure from \"dangerously high\" to \"only slightly higher than normal\", which is good.) He said there wasn't any medication that could help me.</p><p></p><p>Being slightly suspicious of a doctor who Googles your symptoms <em>while you're in the fucking room with him</em>, I managed to acquire some Xanax. (No, I'm not going to tell you where. No, I'm not going to hook you up, either. Don't even ask me.) I reasoned that Xanax is supposed to help with stress -- maybe it would help with this.</p><p></p><p>And it has, by and large: when I take the Xanax, my heart stops doing dubstep beats in my chest. The tradeoff is that it drops my IQ by 50%. I feel like I'm sleepwalking, or like I'm underwater. This is not a good position for a professional computer programmer to be in.</p><p></p><p>I think maybe I've got it sorted now; I haven't taken any Xanax today and for the first time in nearly two weeks, I was mentally and physically capable of working.</p><p></p><p>Which has put me in a bad position, because I'm being paid right now for projects by the hour. So I'm playing catch-up. The problem with that, of course, is that it's nerve-wracking and stressful...which causes my heart to get floppity again, which makes me want to take Xanax so I don't feel like I'm dying all day, which makes me retarded, et cetera et cetera.</p><p></p><p>On the upside, I got the basic framework of Stikki.me's API built tonight, which means the guys I'm working with on the iOS app can start developing it soon, which means one of the biggest assets of Stikki -- the ability to get alerts when you're near a stikki you've set an alarm for -- will be available. And that's game changing.</p><p></p><p>I've also discovered that the prices I'm targeting for advertising on Stikki are less than 10% of what major competitors are charging, which makes me think I'll be able to drum up ad business relatively easily. Since I have no investors or staff, I don't need a massive number of advertisers. Put it another way: if I can get 20 advertisers paying my rate monthly -- 20 advertisers on a service that works <em>globally</em> -- my rent and power bill are paid. 100 and I can devote myself to this full time quite comfortably. 1000 and I'm in that staggering realm of \"upper middle class\" income.</p><p></p><p>If you believe in God, seriously, pray for me. I don't think it'll actually do anything celestially, but I can use all the good wishes I can handle right now. Because money is tight and I'm kind of freaked out.</p><p></p><p>Which is making my heart go pitter-pat, and not in a good way. :-)</p>",

Pressing a key or moving the ring produces no sound on its own; rather, the volume is controlled by a sort of rocker switch.</p><p></p><p>It makes more sense if you see and hear it played. It's a gorgeous, almost unearthly instrument.</p><p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\"   codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/Yy9UBjrUjwo?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"   src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/Yy9UBjrUjwo?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object></p><p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Martenot is a favorite instrument of Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood, who is one of the few modern experts on the device. There aren't very many of them, and you could probably buy a nice car for what you'd pay for one nowadays.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A similar input, used on a very few obscure synths, is a <em>ribbon controller</em>, which replaces the ring with a reactive ribbon; you place your finger on the ribbon and it breaks the circuit, generating a specific frequency. You can buy these to add on to old analog synths or as MIDI controllers.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\"   codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/3EJtgnQa4sY?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"   src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/3EJtgnQa4sY?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object></p><p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Ribbon controllers tend to be expensive -- not as expensive as an ondes Martenot, but I usually see them for a few hundred dollars. Outside my budget for something I'd only use rarely.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Which brings us back to the iPad. The iPad has a touch screen, which means it can very easily be used as a virtual ribbon controller. Beyond that, though, there have been several software instruments designed for the iPad and iPhone which take even better advantage of the device's interface.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">My current favorite is Bebot. Bebot is a small synth app that displays a cute robot on screen. As you touch the screen in various places, the robot \"sings\" the note you're playing. Sounds like a toy, right? But in fact, Bebot is a deceptively powerful little synth. Moving your fingers along the X axis of the screen controls pitch; depending upon which synth voice you're using, Y axis controls either volume or filter. Here's a dude messing around with it on the iPad.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\"   codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/qkhUGB4Xko4?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"   src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/qkhUGB4Xko4?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object></p><p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A simple tool, but it's capable of some fairly beautiful output. The only drawback to Bebot is that you can't record within the app; you need to output it into something else.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Bebot can \"autotune\" your playing to discrete Western half-tone notes (or whatever scale you choose; you can make Bebot only play in E-minor, for example, by selecting the notes used in the preferences panel). Or, like an ondes Martenot, you can use it as a continuous controller, gliding from note to note, using the onscreen grid or your own ears as a guide. Combine this with the ability to control the velocity of your note by sliding up and down, and you've got something that's most equivalent to a fretless bowed string instrument like a cello or violin. Bebot sounds nothing <em>like</em> these instruments...but you could play a violin piece fairly convincingly on it.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">My current favorite music app, Nanostudio, has an on-screen piano keyboard to control its built-in Eden synth (of which you can have four simultaneous instances playing). But it's not physical, it's just pixels on the screen...meaning you can slide back and forth between notes as you would on a ribbon controller. I've discovered that if you set the Eden to monophonic (meaning you can only play a single note at a time) with portamento (meaning one note \"slides\" to the next\"), you can get something that, with a little practice, approximates a continuous controller. What I like is that the glide only happens when you hold notes down; you can still get normal instant notes by playing staccato.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Here's a snippet of my first attempt at this: a cover of Talking Heads' <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqg_ZGcuybs\">\"This Must Be The Place (Naive Melody)\"</a>. I've gotten a bit better at using the Eden since this, but I think this is a cool first attempt. Listen for the synth solo at about 24 seconds in.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\"   codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F8627838\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"   src=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F8627838\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\"></embed></object> <span><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/jzellis/this-must-be-the-place-part\">This Must Be The Place (part)</a> by <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/jzellis\">jzellis</a></span></p><p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span>I'm really excited about <a href=\"http://www.morphwiz.com/\">MorphWiz</a>, an instrument endorsed by keyboardist Jordan Rudess of prog-metal outfit Dream Theater.

            "source": {
                "content": "<p>So Rupert Murdoch's <em><a href=\"http://www.thedaily.com/\">The Daily</a></em> iPad \"newspaper\" <a href=\"http://www.crunchgear.com/2011/01/13/news-corps-the-daily-ipad-newspaper-delayed-by-weeks-not-months/\">is in the news</a>, mainly because it's failed to appear. It seems that publishers are falling all over themselves to come up with their own iPad app-based publications -- <em>Wired</em> and <em>Scientific American </em>were early, semi-successful contenders in the field.</p><p></p><p>I have an iPad, and frankly, I completely fail to see the point of application-based publications, at least from a reader/user's perspective. I am a <em>Wired</em> subscriber, and I'm not willing to pay for another copy of the magazine on my iPad, particularly when most of the content is also available for free from their website. Video-enhanced ads -- one of the big selling points of the <em>Wired</em> app -- do not fill me with excitement in the same way they do, I suspect, for the advertisers themselves. While it's briefly amusing to be able to see a 360º view of an Audi, I'm not in the market for an Audi, and I don't care to see what the passenger side looks like.</p><p></p><p>The fact is that 90% of the \"functionality\" of these apps is just as easily accomplished within a browser using HTML 5, Ajax and Javascript animation. That's if you want the whiz-bang UI fun that most of these apps offer, which I'm not sure I do. In the ten minutes I played with <em>Wired'</em>s iPad app, I didn't feel that the navigation system (scroll up and down to read pages of an article, left and right to switch from article to article) was in any way easier to use or more illuminating than clicking an article's title in a menu. It's slightly groovy, but I mean, come on: this is the 21st century. This is not the most innovative UI we've seen.</p><p></p><p>A far more interesting interface for news is Flipboard, which is a sort of RSS aggregation reader on psychedelics. Instead of simply presenting you with a list of your Google Reader feeds, it extracts images from the feeds (along with your Twitter and Facebook feeds, optionally) and presents you with something that looks more like a \"real\" magazine than most of the magazine apps do. While it doesn't add any efficiency to the task of navigating your news feeds, it does so in an interesting and relatively novel way.</p><p></p><p>Flipboard didn't really become interesting to me, though, until it added the ability to add your own Google Reader feeds, rather than a pre-selected list of \"partner\" feeds, which is how it launched. One of the things that media companies need to understand is that these much-touted partnerships are rarely of interest to anybody but themselves and the companies they're partnering with, the same way wifty ad technology is rarely interesting to anybody but advertisers and the people who depend upon advertising income. Even so, Flipboard is cute, the kind of thing I'd read on the john in the morning, but I use it far less than I use Reeder and River of News, my two favorite RSS aggregator apps for the iPad. (I like River of News's feed organization 100% better than Reeder's, but it has some small UI quirks that keep me using Reeder for now; I hope that changes soon.)</p><p></p><p>You would think that the success of tools like Instapaper might be a flagpost for online media publishers trying to figure out how to succeed: people don't <em>want</em> flashy UIs in their text-based publications. They usually just want to read the goddamn articles and look at the pictures therein. Multimedia is fine, I suppose, but as a parallel alternative method for retrieving information. I don't know about you, but when I see a link to an interview and follow it only to discover that the interview is a video or audio file, not text, I'm often irritated. Multimedia content is usually less dense than text; oftentimes a touted multimedia \"interview\" is a 30 second clip of some toadying goofball asking a celebrity two banal questions.</p><p></p><p>You'd think we'd gotten past that idiotic idea, oft-espoused in the late 1990s and early 2000s, that nobody will read more than 500 words of text online. Instapaper's success alone would seem to prove otherwise. I don't mind reading 2000-3000 word articles or more on my iPad. I just mind reading them broken up into twelve pages that I have to load -- along with all the ads and chrome that online publications are pathologically incapable of not adding to every page. I often click on the \"printable version\" button just to read the article in some sort of mental peace.</p><p></p><p>I've been thinking a lot about how to make a successful online newspaper/magazine, and I'll get into that soon. Meanwhile, I offer this suggestion to publishers: stop this whole multimedia app dick measuring contest and focus on building a web-based magazine that people actually want to read. It's cheaper in the long run.</p>",

            "source": {
                "content": "<p>So I've had an iPad for a few weeks now; I'm beginning to learn iOS development and it seemed like a useful thing to have, as I no longer have an iPhone. (I lost it.) Also, I needed something portable to carry other than my aging MacBook Pro, which is definitely showing signs of wear and tear. Most of what I do with computers can be done on an iPad, barring graphic design work; and I've managed to get around a lot of the iPad's limitations.</p><p></p><p>So I thought I'd share with you the tools and apps I've found coolest and most useful so far.</p><p></p><p><strong>1) A keyboard</strong></p><p>Several years ago, I described in my Las Vegas CityLife column what I thought was the ideal form-factor for a portable computing device: a touch-enabled tablet that could be carried separately from its keyboard. The iPad gets this half-right, and honestly for most casual use the onscreen keyboard is fine. I can average about fifty WPM on it, which is decent for web browsing, tweeting, writing notes, etc.</p><p></p><p>However, I want to use my iPad to write long documents (like fiction) and PHP/HTML/CSS/Javascript code. And for that, you need a physical keyboard. It's not just the tactility of it, though that's a big part of things; it's also the fact that the iPad's virtual keyboard takes up 50% of the screen, and when you're trying to do serious coding or writing that doesn't work.</p><p></p><p>I wanted the Apple bluetooth wireless keyboard, but I didn't want to spend $70 for it. So I got Apple's Camera Connection Kit, which includes a USB-iDevice 30 pin adapter. It's made to stick USB drives into the iPad so you can transfer images onto it, but an undocumented feature is that you can hook other sorts of USB devices in as well...including both QWERTY keyboards and MIDI controllers.</p><p></p><p>I got a $14 mini-keyboard at Fry's to go with it, one of the cheap little ones that sysadmins often buy to hook into servers they rarely need to directly access. It's not bad -- it has a steel frame and it's barely wider than the iPad itself. Keyboard goes into the camera kit, camera kit goes into the iPad. The OS will popup and tell you the device isn't supported, but it works perfectly well. Supposedly you can control the iPad's hardware like volume and the Home button with keyboard combinations, but I haven't figured them out yet.</p><p></p><p>I'm using it now to type this, and it's just as responsive as my desktop, typing within the Safari browser. Selecting with the keyboard works perfectly -- hold down the Shift key and use the arrows, just like a desktop -- though often tabbing around interface stuff doesn't work the way one would expect. But it's a marked improvement.</p><p></p><p><strong>2) Docs-To-Go</strong></p><p>This was my office suite of choice for the iPad, because it supports uploading docs to Google Docs and to Dropbox, which I use extensively. So far it's pretty decent -- almost fullscreen editing of Word documents. I can't figure out if there are keyboard shortcuts for text formatting, but I haven't tried much other than Ctrl-I for italics. I'm thinking of trying out WriteRoom as well, as I have it and love it on the desktop.</p><p></p><p><strong>3) FTP On The Go / Textastic</strong></p><p>For code editing, this is my one-two combo. FTP On The Go is a really full-featured FTP client for iOS that also allows text editing of documents directly from the server. The only reason I use Textastic with it is that FTPOTG doesn't support the only two code editing functions I really need: line numbering and syntax highlighting. Textastic does, though it doesn't have its own FTP client built in. I'm hoping one of these two apps adopts the other one's features so I can just use one, but for right now these are a nice set of tools. I also have iSSH for telnetting or SSHing into servers.</p><p></p><p><strong>4) Reeder</strong></p><p>I'm a Google Reader junkie. Unfortunately, the default UI for it doesn't work properly in Mobile Safari and the mobile version is retarded. So I've been using the popular Reeder app, which syncs with Google Reader, to read my RSS feeds.</p><p></p><p>It has its limitations -- the most irritating being that it navigates via folders, not individual feeds. I organize my feeds with folders, but there are a lot of feeds I don't check regularly or want to basically ignore most of the time. For example, my News folder has Google News, Yahoo News, and the Guardian UK's Culture feed. I can't look at just one of these with Reeder -- they all show up, either organized by the feed itself or by time. I'd rather just be able to only look at one feed at a time.</p><p></p><p>I just got the River of News app, which seems to be much closer to what I really want in a RSS reader UI, but it seems a bit slow, interface-wise -- it loads each item slowly and sometimes cuts off images. But we'll see.</p><p></p><p><strong>5) Instapaper</strong></p><p>Instapaper on the iPad is an incredibly useful tool. You can save entire web pages to it for later viewing. It also reformats the page and strips out everything but the main text and images, displaying it in minimalist black and white. The iOS app downloads the page and stores it locally, so you can read pages even when you're not online. And you can send things to it from Twitter or Reeder, which rocks -- if I find an interesting article in Reeder or somebody posts a link to something, I just send it to Instapaper and check it out later.</p><p></p><p><strong>6) iBooks</strong></p><p>I haven't bothered with the Kindle or Nook readers for iPad, because iBooks does what I want it to do and does it well. The only problem I have with it is that it won't display PDFs in a two-page spread -- the PDF page only shows up one page at a time. But it's not a deal breaker. It's also awesome for reading comics.</p><p></p><p><strong>7) Nanostudio</strong></p><p>My current favorite app. Nanostudio is a portable electronic music studio, similar to Propellerheads' Rebirth or Beatstudio. But Nanostudio is more flexible, featuring four dual-oscillator synths and an MPC-style sampler. You can mix down your loops directly into the sampler, export each part of the song individually, record samples from the mic or input, and output your mixes directly into SoundCloud. The onscreen keyboard is actually usable, and I've managed to make it work like a ribbon controller. (If you don't know what this means, don't worry. It's music nerd speak.)</p><p></p><p>I'm sure I'll come up with more, but this is the basic list. </p>",

                "content": "<p>I've been doing a lot of thinking about the whole <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks\">Wikileaks</a> thing these past few weeks, like a lot of people who belong to my particular sub-set of the human population. (<a href=\"http://therealfirstworldproblems.tumblr.com/\">First World</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9qYF9DZPdw\">technology-oriented</a>, <a href=\"http://reidwords.wordpress.com/2009/02/26/portland-my-little-liberal-hipster-redneck/\">somewhat politically minded</a>. <a href=\"http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/\">White as a goddamn ghost</a>.)</p><p></p><p>I'm massively ambiguous about the whole affair, which has earned me my fair share of sneering and disbelieving virtual glares from my friends and fellow travelers. (I use that term in the most ironic way possible.) My own ambiguity surprises me, because in theory this is the sort of thing I've been wanting to see happen for most of my life. I've <a href=\"http://www.lasvegascitylife.com/articles/2003/07/30/scorched_earth/all_tomorrows_parties/atp.txt\">always been a card-carrying dyed-in-the-wool cyberpunk type</a>; even though I've disagreed with the <a href=\"http://www.eff.org/\">EFF</a> on issues involving digital music, I support them with all my heart (and occasionally, when I can afford it, my wallet). Transparency in government is something I'm a fervent believer in.</p><p></p><p>So why does this whole thing make me uneasy?</p><p></p><p>I think it's tied into a lot of the reservations I've been feeling, for a long time now, about the hacker culture in general. Not the \"<a href=\"http://makezine.com/\">get excited and write code</a>\" part of hacker culture, which I find deeply meaningful and valuable to humanity as a whole, even if some of the participants can be deeply tedious party guests. But there's also a flip side to the cleverness and ingenuity of hacker culture; a deep arrogance and near-sociopathology.</p><p></p><p>In America at least, there's a big crossover between the hacker and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_Party_(United_States)\">libertarian</a> communities. Though I was at one point in my late teens registered as a libertarian -- mainly because they were the political party least likely to send me irritating snail mail -- I've come to have a deep distaste for libertarianism. These days, I tend to believe that European Union-style socialist democracy is probably the most humane economic and political system we've got. I might be wrong on that...but I don't believe that American capitalism works, and I've come to abhor the notion of a world ruled entirely by capitalism, oligarchy and the <a href=\"http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/?page_id=1180\">Grim Meathook Future</a> of a totally free market.</p><p></p><p>A lot of hackers I know personally are basically heavy libertarian types. They hate the government, they hate taxes. They're smart and very capable of taking care of themselves and don't have a lot of time for people who don't. They seem to apply the same sneering contempt to poor people that they do to clueless Windows users; it's that same sense of superiority to those who haven't figured out how to hack the system. Most of them are only political in as far as privacy and tax issues are concerned. I'm not saying all hackers are like this...but this archetype certainly covers a fair number of the ones I know, and I know quite a lot of them.</p><p></p><p>(Even though I write code professionally, I don't consider myself a hacker, because I'm not interested in code or systems or exploits for their own sake. There's not really a name for what I am -- somebody who thinks about lots of different things and then talks about them or tries to make them happen in a variety of media. \"Dilettante\" is probably <em>le mot juste</em>.)</p><p></p><p>Another trait of a lot of hackers I know is an unwillingness to concern themselves with the long-term ramifications of what they do. Their primary motivation is boredom and a desire to be very clever. Which is a great motivator for smart people...but when you've got the keys (or lock picks) to a lot of kingdoms, a lack of foresight can cause some very serious problems in the real world. Being capable of hacking into credit card companies and getting millions of card numbers and personal identification information for people is a really cool skill...but putting it out into the world can cause some really serious harm to people who, unlike the credit card companies, don't even deserve it in theory.</p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/gawker-hacked-2010-12\">Gawker thing</a> is a perfect example. When Anonymous (or whatever subset of Anonymous) hacked into Gawker and put the user logins and passwords up for display, the first people who dived for that information were spammers, who used it to log into people's Facebook accounts and email and send massive amounts of penis enlargement spam and other weird nonsense -- for their own monetary gain, of course. (Happened to me, which is why I'm never, ever going to comment on a blog again.) It was an inconvenience at worst, but the point remains: the collateral damage wasn't done to Gawker, it was done to people whose chief crime was wanting to respond to a post about the <em>Doctor Who</em> Christmas special or to tell other like-minded people what their favorite note-taking app for the iPhone was.</p><p></p><p>That complete lack of interest in the damage inflicted upon innocent bystanders is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy\">psychopathic</a>. It's putting one's own political or personal ideology, or simple desire to feel like God, above the well-being of others. It is, in fact, precisely the sort of thing that people despise about corporations and governments in the first place.</p><p></p><p>But most of the hackers I know winked and tut-tutted at the whole thing, or the A<a href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/d/security-central/anonymous-takes-down-visacom-in-wikileaks-protest-925\">nonymous attacks on Visa and MasterCard and Paypal</a>. Because, really, anybody stupid enough to use the same password for all their accounts -- or to use credit or debit or online payment systems -- really deserved what they got, right?</p><p></p><p>The same way a woman who's assaulted while walking down the street dressed provocatively deserves what she gets, for being so stupid, right?</p><p></p><p>Which brings us back to Wikileaks, in a roundabout way. The debate over <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/sep/01/sweden-julian-assange-rape-investigation\">the sexual assault case against Julian Assange</a> has become incredibly tedious to me. I don't know if he raped or assaulted those two women, and neither do you. I <em>do</em> find the reaction of the Swedish authorities and Interpol to be a bit unlikely, at the very least: I can't think of any other occasion when Interpol put an APB out on someone accused -- not convicted -- of sexual assault. Whether the charges were politically motivated or not, the response very obviously is.</p><p></p><p>But as for the charges themselves, I care as much as I care about any other investigation into assault charges involving people I don't know, which is not a whole hell of a lot. Sorry. If it happened the way the women say it did, Assange needs to answer for it. If not, he should walk. That's the level of my concern and care now. The hysteria on every side of that debate (feminist, anti-feminist, conspiracist) has just become horrible noise.</p><p></p><p>For the record, here's what I believe about Wikileaks:</p><p></p><p>1)<em> </em>I don't think they're journalists, in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism\">the traditional sense</a>. There's no journalism going on; just massive data dumping. Redacting things isn't the same as verifying material, putting it into perspective; all the things traditional journalists would do. (Snarky prick alert: Nor do I think that traditional journalism is just \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Randolph_Hearst\">Old Media</a>\" and totally lame and the past, and that Wikileaks is the \"new way\" and totally awesome and the future, and if you do I don't care, because I've walked every side of that particular fence and I know every inch of it by feel and smell and I doubt you do, so be quiet. That debate is deeply nuanced and it's not played out yet.)</p><p></p><p>2) I absolutely, utterly, completely believe that the American government has no right to prosecute Julian Assange or to attack Wikileaks in any way. He's not an American citizen and he does not fall under American jurisdiction. Even if he was, it's fairly clear he would fall under First Amendment and whistleblower protection, the same way that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_Papers\">Daniel Ellsberg was when he gave out the Pentagon Papers</a>. It would also be a grievous moral act on my government's part...not that anybody seems to care about that anymore.</p><p></p><p>3) I believe that what Wikileaks has done with the Afghanistan information and with these diplomatic cables is not going to make the American government more transparent in its dealings with its citizens or with other nations. It's going to have the opposite effect: it's going to make people who are already paranoid about information leakage a lot more paranoid. And I don't like the idea of hyper-paranoid people with their finger on the metaphorical button or buttons.</p><p></p><p>4) I don't believe that Assange gave one nimble rat's fuck about the collateral damage he might cause by releasing this information, any more than the Anonymous hackers who've been hacking into things in his name did about the damage they might cause. Assange strikes me as a rather archetypal sociopathic black-hat hacker type. I've debated other people who are involved in Wikileaks, and it's my impression that several of them are precisely the kind of libertarian hackers I've been talking about; from everything I've seen, so is Assange. I could be wrong about that, but based on the evidence I've seen, that's my guess.</p><p></p><p>I'm also bemused by the sheer hypocrisy that is being shown by every player in this affair. Assange wants transparency but gets outraged when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/dec/17/julian-assange-sweden\">somebody leaks details of his sexual assault case to the <em>Guardian</em></a>; Anonymous wants to tear down the walls of the secret-keepers, but do so from behind their own obscuring wall of anonymity; the hacker community that is so vocally supporting Assange's attack upon secrecy are the same people who routinely also bitch about the government spying on them and searching them at airports and trying to make them, as private citizens and as business operators, pay their full share of taxes. I'm a big believer in consistency of thought and action: you can't have it both ways, kids. You want an end to secrecy, fine; but that means <em>your</em> secrets can be spilled too.</p><p></p><p>Do I ultimately think Wikileaks is a good thing? Yes. And no. Both. Either way, I think it's a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora's_box\">Pandora's box</a> that has been irrevocably opened. Things are going to change because of this; the whole notion of privacy and secrecy is going to be turned upside down, not just for governments but for all of us. I also think this is the beginning of a new era of net warfare, played out between governments and NGOs and groups that don't even have memberships or know who they themselves are, like Anonymous. I think the main outcome is going to be that living online is going to get a whole lot more irritating.</p><p></p><p>And I'd like to believe that, just like with the mythical Pandora's box, hope still lies somewhere at the bottom of all of this.</p><p></p><p>(For further reading, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Sterling\">Big Bruce Sterling</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.webstock.org.nz/blog/2010/the-blast-shack/\">thoughts on all this</a>.)</p>",

I wonder why I haven't ever heard anyone else mention this in public. (Maybe they have; I haven't seen it.)</p><p></p><p>It occurred to me that if I were working in either the governmental or private intelligence communities, Wikileaks would seem to me to be a remarkably useful tool for playing infowar games.</p><p></p><p>Wikileaks is a totally independent quasi-organization that will publish any significant leaked information packages they receive, without naming the source, so long as (presumably) the information can be verified to be accurate. Correct?</p><p></p><p>Now: everyone <em>assumes</em> Bradley Manning is the source for the Cablegate documents, but nobody's confirmed or denied this, and it wouldn't really matter if they had. I find it hard to believe Manning could have gotten access to those (non-military) documents and compiled them without nobody noticing, but then, maybe the people who run security for the government really are that stupid.</p><p></p><p>But let's imagine another alternative: let's say you run intel for a large government. Say China, because the Chinese government is very interested in information warfare. Let's say you managed to get your hands on these diplomatic cables.</p><p></p><p>As intel, they're nearly worthless, as Umberto Eco <a href=\"http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/414871-not-such-wicked-leaks\">points out</a>. Nothing of any real value. A mess o' pottage.</p><p></p><p>But wait. What if I were to leak this hunk of useless shit to Julian Assange? Carefully edited to remove anything we don't like, of course, and leaving in anything we want to use to send a message. (Like that we're <a href=\"http://www.nowpublic.com/world/wikileaks-cablegate-china-government-ordered-google-hack-2732852.html\">engaging in unofficial attacks on one of the US's major info hubs</a>. Google assuredly knew this was happening, but didn't say anything. Terrorism, by definition, is the act of instilling fear in people for political gain. Think about it.)</p><p></p><p>I can submit it anonymously or create a false identity to reach out to Wikileaks. Either way, it won't be traced back to me by the public because Wikileaks has a vested interest in maintaining trust with potential whistleblowers. Wikileaks is a non-governmental group, which is in fact condemned by a number of major governments, whose stated goal is transparency and accountability. So nobody's going to suspect I'm using them as a cat's-paw.</p><p></p><p>If Wikileaks attempts to verify the information with the US government (officially or surreptitiously) they'll discover that it does indeed stand up, because most of it is quite legitimate, and it seems unlikely that Wikileaks has a way of checking the integrity of each document in the whole big mess.</p><p></p><p>I know that people will pore over it; eventually they'll find whatever it was I wanted them to find, and trumpet it to the world. <em>And it can't ever be traced back to me or the government that employs me</em>.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, I drop a few grand in the Wikileaks PayPal account just to keep things running smoothly.</p><p></p><p>I'm not saying this is what happened with the Cablegate documents. But does it really sound impossible or even unlikely? The very nature of what Wikileaks does means that there's no transparency in their sourcing of information. If I did work in intelligence, I'd be working on ways to use that to my advantage. I mean, Assange says he's going to drop info on a major US bank next. Fine, but which one? Who gave him the information? Who stands to benefit from Wikileaks exposure?</p><p></p><p>I don't actually doubt Assange's sincerity or his motives, really. But that doesn't mean his sources are pure or altruistic. And if somebody smart enough wanted to use Wikileaks as a tool for governmental or corporate skullduggery, I don't see what, in theory, would prevent them.</p><p></p><p>Just a thought.</p>",

We got a lot of coverage for it -- the early 21st century version of retweets -- and were nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. (Your publisher nominates you, so it's not <em>that</em> big of a deal, but it was still pretty cool.)</p><p></p><p>Matt went on to continue exploring the drains, ultimately writing a book about his experiences, <em>Beneath The Neon</em>. I went off to start a dot.com. Though I've been down in the drains a few times since, Matt was the one who really kept involved with the situation and the lives of the people down below. He even founded a community project, <a href=\"http://www.beneaththeneon.com/shine-a-light.asp\">Shine A Light</a>, to help people get out of the darkness and into recovery programs and housing.</p><p></p><p>A lot has changed since I was last down there. For one thing, there are a lot more people than there were before (though nowhere near the 700+ that Britain's <em>The Sun</em> <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/2651937/The-people-living-in-drains-below-Las-Vegas.html\">suggests</a>). And the people who <em>are </em>down there seem to have made the transition from crashers to squatters; several of them had incredibly organized and elaborate \"houses\". The drains are beginning to look less like a place to doss down for a few nights or a week, and more like a <a href=\"http://mastersofmedia.hum.uva.nl/2009/12/21/bruce-sterling-gothic-chic-in-the-future-favela/\">Sterlingian interstitial <em>favela</em></a>. The very existence of these subterranean temporary autonomous zones is a quirk of Las Vegas's uniquely Manichean climate and geography: it's either bone-dry or flooding here at any given time. The fact that it's mostly the former is why people <em>can</em> take up semi-permanent residence in the storm drains here. They're almost always dry, except when they're not...and if you're in them when a wall of water comes rushing down out of the western mountains, you're probably dead.</p><p></p><p>This is both heartening and disturbing. Heartening in the sense that these people are establishing some sort of equilibrium for themselves, no matter how ephemeral or transitory; a couple of folks mentioned losing all their mostly dumpster-obtained possessions when floods came through. But it's also disturbing in the sense that eight years after Matt and I alerted the world to the problem, <em>storm drains are still serving as a substitute for homeless shelters in Las Vegas</em>.</p><p></p><p>The official treatment of the homeless by Las Vegas and Clark County is <a href=\"http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/apr/03/growing-homeless-settlement-vexes-business-goodman/\">reprehensible</a>, bordering in some cases on outright human rights violations. Mayor Oscar Goodman made the national news by <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/21/us/21brfs-NEVADAJUDGEB_BRF.html?_r=1&amp;ref=oscar_b_goodman\">attempting several years ago to make it illegal to give food to homeless people</a>. This was after he made the statement publicly that Las Vegas \"has no homeless problem\", a statement which any resident or off-Strip visitor to the city can tell you is ludicrous, bordering on the surreal. I can't find the exact numbers at the moment, but a few years ago I saw a statistic which suggested that less than 1% of Clark County's budget went to social services. This <em>wouldn't</em> surprise any Las Vegas residents. The streets (and the tunnels beneath them) are full of walking wounded, human casualties of addiction and mental illness, not to mention people who simply fell through the cracks of an increasingly depressed local economy.</p><p></p><p>Several months ago, I was having a conversation with an acquaintance who told me that \"80% of the homeless are addicts\" and that most of them don't want help -- that the services are there if they want them. In the case of social services, this is simply and demonstrably untrue: both public and private services for the homeless and for addicts here are criminally underfunded. More than one of the people I met in the drains yesterday told me they were on waiting lists for housing and treatment programs, sometimes for months. And when you live in a concrete cave under a city, you may not have months to wait on help.</p><p></p><p>But more to the point, I think, this is an example of a deeper, underlying attitude I see again and again in Las Vegas: a profound and distressing lack of empathy for those in need. Put another way: this is a mean-ass town. If Las Vegas has a <em>spiritus urbus</em>, it's psychopathic.</p><p></p><p>Yes, a great percentage, maybe even the majority of homeless people are addicts. So what? Las Vegas is a city of addiction. I'd personally guess the rate of alcoholism in the city runs about 10%, maybe higher, most of it undiagnosed or treated. (That includes, ironically, the acquaintance who was railing about homeless addicts.) Even more are hooked on illicitly-obtained prescription pills. And God only knows how many gambling addicts manage to keep their addiction in just enough check to keep a roof over their heads. This is a city that subtly and not-so-subtly celebrates alcohol culture, cocaine culture, speed culture. Goodman himself is a notorious public drunk who <a href=\"http://www.8newsnow.com/story/3021912/las-vegas-mayor-makes-controversial-gin-comment?redirected=true\">once told an audience of schoolchildren</a> that if he only had one thing to take to a desert island, he'd bring a bottle of Bombay Sapphire gin.</p><p></p><p>Apparently it's okay to be a drunk or a crackhead or a junkie in Las Vegas, so long as you can hold your shit. Lose your handle on your own vices and you aren't worth saving.</p><p></p><p>The people beneath Las Vegas's neon can't rely on the city or the county or the state to help them, and they don't seem to be able to rely on the goodwill of their fellow citizens; most Las Vegans don't know they're down there and most of the ones who do wouldn't piss on them if they were on fire. And their numbers seem to be slowly, steadily growing. These people live in the cold, in the dark, in shit-smelling tunnels where no light shines, like fucking rats. That's not acceptable.</p><p></p><p>Matt's working a lot with <a href=\"http://www.helpsonv.org/\">Help of Southern Nevada</a> to help people get out of the drains and back into the world. I'm working on ideas for how to raise money for HOSN to give them more opportunity to help the people in the drains, and I'll post more on that as I come up with viable notions.</p><p></p><p>In the meantime, <a href=\"http://www.helpsonv.org/get_involved-donate.php\">throw your spare holiday change at HOSN</a>, even if you don't live in Las Vegas. Help them help the people who cannot help themselves. Help them shine a light in the darkness.</p><p></p><p></div></p>",

            "name": "Finding Common Ground.",
            "source": {
                "content": "<p>I was much inspired by <a href=\"http://www.enduringamerica.com/home/2010/10/31/rally-for-sanity-video-and-transcript-jon-stewarts-speech.html\">Jon Stewart's speech</a> at the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/30/jon-stewart-rally-restore-sanity\">Rally to Restore Sanity</a>, which I only got around to seeing today. (I had planned to attend the local Vegas edition, but I was busy getting ready to be married the next day, which is a valid excuse.)</p><p></p><p>I was particularly struck by one thing that Stewart said: \"We live now in hard times, not end times.\" It's often hard to remember that. One of the side effects of being fascinated by the history of religion is that you become aware that Westerners have believed that they were living at the end of the world pretty much since the time of Constantine. It has always been a part of Christian eschatology, and as such has pervaded Western culture for almost two thousand years, a strange sort of collective cognitive bias. (I have never gotten the impression that this is part of any other major religion's established worldview, though it obviously forms the basis of lots of crazypants cults and such.)</p><p></p><p>The reason it always seems that things are getting worse is because humans tend to have a built-in idea that \"change\" = \"bad\". We establish our foundation of <em>how things are </em>in our childhood; as we age, we see that foundation challenged day by day. Radio becomes movies becomes television becomes the Web becomes Twitter. Colored becomes Negro becomes Afro-American becomes African-American becomes person of color. Gay stops meaning \"happy\". America stops being the happiest place on Earth to live. Greed becomes good, then bad, then good again.</p><p></p><p>But change, as the very most fundamental laws of physics tell us, is inevitable and indeed constant, from the atomic level all the way up to the structure of the universe itself. Change is the Terminator; you can't argue with it, can't reason with it...except unlike the Terminator, change doesn't stop when you're dead. The world keeps turning.</p><p></p><p>Fighting change is a Sisyphean task at best; at worst, it can be an act of atrocity. Part of my dislike of conservativism of any stripe is the underlying principle of trying to keep things the way they <em>were</em>. In the case of American conservatism, this is usually predicated by a desire to return to a notional \"happier, simpler time\". The fact that such a time never really existed, of course, doesn't stop people from imagining it to be a worthy goal. A lot of white middle-class Americans believe that the 1950s and early 1960s were a utopian era; and maybe they were, for white heteronormative middle-class Americans. It wasn't a lot of fun to be black in 1952 in America, or an independent female, or queer, or mentally challenged, or mentally ill,or physically challenged, or atheist. In fact, for anybody who wasn't getting their picture painted by Norman Rockwell, life in America pretty much sucked.</p><p></p><p>Not that it's perfect now, but over the last forty years at least we've started to understand that the way we lived and the assumptions we made back then -- what we defined as \"normal\" and \"healthy\" and \"right\" -- were not absolutes, that in fact in a lot of ways we were kind of barbaric assholes. We've confronted racism and bigotry and hatred head-on, and seen them for what they are.</p><p></p><p>Not all of us, of course. There are still many Americans who believe that homosexuality is a sin, that atheists are incapable of morality, that Hispanics are trying to undermine America by sneaking over the border to take American jobs and abuse the privileges of American citizenship. There are people who believe that marijuana is more dangerous than alcohol, that Muslims hate freedom, that the President is secretly a resident alien who is bound and determined to take everything away from them -- their guns, their money, their freedom, and their God.</p><p></p><p>But I believe that Stewart is essentially right: these people make up a small but vocal minority. Most Americans are just people, with a tapestry woven of convictions and indifferences. Sure, there are people who want to build concentration camps for the friends of Dorothy; there are people who would like to see the Bible banned not only from schools but from private houses. But not many, and the wonderful thing about a society whose first and foremost principle is free speech is that these people are allowed to speak loud and long...which means we <em>know where they are</em>.</p><p></p><p>There are many things that I disagree with conservatives about, vehemently. I believe that human rights are universal. I believe in gay marriage and transgender marriage and what they used to call miscegenation. I believe that all Americans have the right to be happy in whatever way makes them happy, so long as that happiness does not directly interfere with the rights of others to the same thing. I believe in the rights of sex workers. I believe in the legalization and taxation of drugs. I am an atheist, and I believe that it is wrong to teach religious mythology about the nature of the universe and biology in schools <em>as equal and viable alternatives to scientifically based theories</em>. But I am not in favor of censoring such beliefs, or attempting to prevent people from having those beliefs, or adhering to them as moral values.</p><p></p><p>The problem is that nothing is that simple. Fundamentalist Christianity and Islam teach that certain widespread human behaviors, such as homosexuality or independent thought in women or the use of certain chemicals, are contrary to the moral intent of the creator of the universe. How do we square that with the belief that everyone is equal, that it's okay to love whomever you choose so long as they are of legal age to love you back or to be a woman without a man to guide her, or to kick back and smoke a joint and chill out in your back yard listening to the Doobie Brothers?</p><p></p><p>Well, actually, now that I write that, the answer does seem pretty simple after all: we err on the side of allowing other people to live and let live, and we agree to disagree. We don't call each other Nazis unless we're actually behaving like the Nazis did: namely, rounding up all the people we think are bad and doing our best to exterminate them. We don't call each other fascists unless we're actually engaging in fascist behavior. We don't call each other Stalinists unless we're doing what Big Joe did: attempting to control not only the behavior but the thoughts and beliefs of our fellow citizens.</p><p></p><p>Here's where I differ from a lot of other people who, like me, call themselves leftists or liberals: I don't believe we can entirely wipe out racism, or sexism, or homophobia, or sexual violence between men and women, or nationalism, or bigotry towards those of different religions beliefs or no religious beliefs, or economic and class-based prejudice. I think that these things are part of human nature. There have been societies without some of these things, to be sure, but no society has ever existed without <em>any</em> of them.</p><p></p><p>But I do believe that we can do our best to make them individual, not collective, beliefs. One man or woman's racism is inevitable; institutional racism is unacceptable. I believe that a Christian who thinks that gay marriage is wrong is perfectly within his or her rights to believe that, but I do not believe that his or her belief should in any way impact a gay couple's right to get married. Jews and Muslims have all the right in the world to believe that the other ones are going to Hell; but they should have absolutely no right to harm or persecute or inflict societal persecution upon those others.</p><p></p><p>I believe that the First and Ninth Amendments pretty much cover it:</p><p><ul></p><p><li>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</li></p><p><li>The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.</li></p><p></ul></p><p>There you have it. The <em>only</em> laws that prohibit gay marriage are religious ones; Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion; therefore, Congress shall make no law opposing gay marriage. It doesn't matter if you oppose gay marriage or not, because you are a citizen of the United States, and in the United States (<em>all</em> the United States), we do not and cannot pass laws which establish one set of religious beliefs over another (or lack thereof). It's also illegal to make laws banning people from praying or believing the world was made in seven days or that it is wrong for a woman to appear in public without covering herself from head to toe. I may not like that, but again, not my call to make...and thank goodness for that.</p><p></p><p>It is hard not to see the right wing as being the instigators in the current atmosphere of rabid public discourse. The greatest trick that Ronald Reagan pulled as President was to somehow inextricably tangle fiscal conservativism with social and religious conservativism. To my mind, there is no obvious connection; it is perfectly possible to believe in privatized health care and also be a gay atheist, for example. And though I myself am not particularly fiscally conservative as a political stance -- I tend to believe in socializing a certain subset of services for citizens, such as health care, on the grounds that it makes economic sense in the long term if not the short term -- I can agree to disagree, respectfully, with people who are, within reason; I have absolutely no time for rabid libertarians who believe in abolishing taxation entirely, because it's frankly a stupid argument that ignores human nature as thoroughly as any hardline leftist Communist doctrine does.</p><p></p><p>I can agree to politely disagree with people who believe in the right of every American to carry a lethal firearm -- not because I agree with them, but because I believe that issue is so complex and so hardwired into the basic laws of our country that it deserves more debate, and that there are no easy answers.</p><p></p><p>I can even agree to politely disagree with those who think homosexuality or transgenderism is a sin, or that certain ethnic groups or races are inferior to others, or that women deserve to be treated differently than men. I may find their views abhorrent, but I also find it abhorrent that many people believe Lady Gaga to be an important, transgressive artist, or that sports should take precedence over academics in our public school system. And I suspect that many of my views are abhorrent to these people as well.</p><p></p><p>I can do that politely, if not with respect; I don't respect people who deny the evidence of their senses and scientific method and continue to live their lives based upon the notion that the world was made in a week six thousand years ago, based on oral mythology created by Bronze Age nomads who thought the entire universe consisted of the desert they wandered and possibly the mountains on the other side. But you know what? They don't respect me for thinking dudes should be able to get married and make out in public. And that's totally fine.</p><p></p><p>We are a nation of nearly three hundred million people, and the only thing we all have in common is believing that our politicians are corrupt and that the world would be a better place if the entire cast of <em>Jersey Shore</em> got hit by a meteorite. What we desperately need to do is to just be okay with that, and to calm the fuck down and try to find our commonalities.</p><p></p><p>The only thing I can really say in favor of liberalism versus conservatism is that, by and large, liberals are not trying to take away your right to do anything (except not pay taxes). Conservatives right now are the ones who are telling you you can't marry somebody of the same sex, or walk around simultaneously believing that the notion of a personal God is bullshit <em>and</em> that you should be able to be elected to public office, that you can be a Muslim and not be treated as if you're trying to blow up every goddamn plane you see.</p><p></p><p>Why? Fear, I think. It's that fear of change. Somebody said to me recently that they'd seen a statistic that the number of Muslims in America was estimated to double in the next twenty years. I responded with <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=OTzgXwoyRkEC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=bill+hicks+pornography+yeah+and+so+what&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=h-oercCtva&amp;sig=qApumj20aYd2WmfQMtbAgpsevsM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MN7PTOyALoiWsgOu19yJBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">the four questions I learned to ask from Bill Hicks</a>: Yeah? And? So? What? So what if 50% of Americans were Muslims? As long as they were Muslims who respected the rights of other people to <em>not</em> be Muslims, so what? So what if we elect a woman as President who likes to eat pussy? The world changes. The people on top of the heap go to the bottom, and the people below them move on up and finally get a piece of the pie, and then twenty years or a hundred years later it flip-flops again. This is how the world works.</p><p></p><p>I read <a href=\"http://exiledonline.com/the-rally-to-restore-vanity-generation-x-celebrates-its-homeric-struggle-against-lameness/\">a criticism of the Rally to Restore Sanity</a> which, in essence, suggests that the whole affair was a way for hipster Generation X America to show that we're so ironic we don't need to actually get involved to affect change. I don't think that's true. For one thing, it is my experience that ideologues of either stripe are scary, humorless people. (It's why I can't live in the Bay Area; too many tedious self-righteous lefties, the kind of people who you wish weren't on your side.) I am an unwavering supporter of GLBTQ rights across the board, but I can't stand being around hardcore queer activist types any more than I can stand being around anti-abortion activists. Their hearts might be in the right place, but man, those motherfuckers can't take a goddamn joke.</p><p></p><p>And that's what it all comes down to. We all take ourselves far too seriously in this country, on <em>either</em> side. We get worked up and we start drawing battle lines and calling the people we disagree with monsters and we crank up the volume on public discourse to ear-shattering levels. As Stewart said in his speech: if we amplify everything, we hear nothing.</p><p></p><p>I'm not saying I'm exempt from this criticism. Hell, I'm a terrible loudmouth and I talk shit and behave like a dismissive asshole. I'm aware of it. What I'm saying here is that Jon Stewart and his massive act of comedic performance art have made me reconsider my own hysteria and hypocrisy.</p><p></p><p>Maybe it's because I got married less than 48 hours ago and I'm in a sort of warm, fuzzy daze, but I think I'd like to make a promise to myself: I'm going to calm the fuck down and maybe try to cool it with the cheap shots. Not all religious people are retarded bigots. (Even though, let's be honest: in the Big Three Western religions at least, the amount of retarded bigotry one displays is directly proportional to how literally one takes one's chosen faith.) Not all fiscal conservatives are Scrooge-like bastards who kick ghetto children in the face; many of them are just people who have trouble paying the bills, the way I do. Our ideas for fixing our problems are different, that's all.</p><p></p><p>I'm not saying there aren't evil motherfuckers out there who deserve scorn and rage, but I'm going to try to be a bit more precise in my verbal carpet-bombing of them, and more constructive in my criticism of people who simply believe differently than I do. I can't promise I won't slip up and, say, mock Catholics for believing that God tells them to fill every goddamn square inch of the Earth's landmass with dribbling unwanted idiot children. But I'll do my best.</p><p></p><p>We needed a rally to restore sanity in America; to remind us that we're all in this together, Christian, Buddhist, Muslim, queer, straight, atheist, rich, poor, Republican, Democrat, and that we'll go a lot further if we stop trying to destroy each other like characters in a bad fantasy novel, and maybe just sit down and figure out the bits we've got in common first, and the things we can agree upon. Even if it's nothing more than agreeing that deep down inside, we all really, <em>really</em> hate that Snooki chick.</p>",

The campaign was created in response to a recent rash of suicides by young <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT\">LGBTQ</a> kids.

I'm not gay, but I still got gay-bashed in school a lot, because I wasn't particularly macho and I spoke well and dressed...er, <em>eclecticall</em>y...and I was friends with a few gay kids and people who later came out. I had a few friends who got it worse than I did, and one of my acquaintances, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Shepard\">Matthew Shepherd</a>, got it <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Laramie_Project\">about as bad as you can get it</a>. My uncle Kevin was also gay; he contracted HIV in 1982, got full-blown AIDS in 1984 and survived until 2002, when he died of a brain tumor he'd been diagnosed with at the same time he'd been diagnosed with AIDS; the doctors didn't remove it because at the time it was benign, and because in 1984 AIDS was a death sentence that was always quickly carried out. All of Kevin's lovers and, later, his husbands, were treated like members of our family; his first husband Michael died in my great-grandfather's arms. So I grew up with gay family members and friends.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But I think this message is vital not just for members of the LGBTQ community, but for<em> every </em>kid, especially the kids whose wonderful minds and personalities mark them as being different from the herd. Goth kids, emo kids, nerds, geeks, freaks, art fags, dorks, hippie kids...every school has at least a few of them. Like me.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">I hated every minute of my schooling, from kindergarten onward. I hated the other kids, I hated the teachers, I hated the school administration. I fought every single day not to go to school. And why not? For eleven years I was sent to a place where I was subjected to emotional and often physical cruelty from my peers and indifference and often outright hostility from my educators.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Why? Because I wasn't like my peers. I was smarter than almost all of them; sorry, but that's just the flat truth. I was curious and easily bored and I didn't know how to keep my head down. I was sarcastic and I was insolent, because I hated being where I was and hated the people around me and had absolutely no choice in being where I was. I liked to read, not sit around talking about fucking WWF wrestling. I liked writing music and making art on my computer. I was autodidactic; I educated myself, for the most part, because I ignored my teachers and my schoolwork. I got almost straight Fs from sixth grade onward, except usually in my English classes. When I sat down in my first class, all I could think of was making it to lunchtime without getting humiliated or assaulted; after lunch, I just waited to be sent home.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">What I learned in school wasn't reading, writing and arithmetic; I learned hatred and fear, and I learned that my nominal job in society was to do what I was told. I didn't learn that lesson then, and at the age of thirty-two, I haven't learned it now. I do not do what I am told.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">I know I'm not alone. Maybe you were one of those kids, who sat in those uncomfortable little desk-chairs and ignored the whispers of \"Hey, faggot. Hey, faggot. Hey, cocksucker,\" and the spitwads and the slaps in the back of the head when the teacher wasn't looking; one of the kids who plotted their walk home to avoid where the bullies hung out; one of those kids who sat in their bedroom and thought about putting a gun in your mouth or a noose around your neck because the years until graduation seemed to stretch out like a life sentence with absolutely no hope of parole.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Maybe you're one of those kids now. Maybe you're queer, maybe you're not; maybe you're just different, the way I was different, the way my friends were different. Maybe you're scared and hurting and just sick to fucking death of being treated like shit because you don't wear the same clothes or like the same music or watch the same TV. Maybe you're having as hard a time as I did seeing the exit door.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">If so, I'd like to tell you something. It's a secret your teachers won't tell you, your parents probably won't tell you, it's something you may secretly believe but deny to yourself in the face of all of the people who are telling you otherwise. The secret is this.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">You're right.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">You're smarter than they are. Really. Trust me. The great thing about Facebook is that I can look and see what the assholes who tormented me are up to. Most of them are sad, pathetic, boring adults. They have tiny lives. Most of them seem to have gotten their skanky girlfriends knocked up at an early age, and have a giant brood of nasty little piglet children. They still like shitty music. They got puffy around the face, the kind of puffy you get when you spend your life getting shit-faced on cheap beer with the rest of the retards because you can't face the blank wall that is your future. Most of them never left home, or got more than a couple of hundred miles away. A lot of them love Jesus to a really scary degree. Hey, I don't blame them. If I'd fucked this life up, I'd probably spend all my time dreaming of the next one too.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">You're right about your teachers, too. Most of them just don't give a shit about you. They're drawing a paycheck. There are a few who really care -- and you'll remember them, for the rest of your life. A few months ago I called up my wonderful guidance counselor, Clarice Boring, and told her about my impending marriage and my life, and thanked her for being one of those lights during a dark and scary time. You might have an English teacher or an art teacher -- or in my fiancee's case, drama teachers -- who are like that. Man, treasure them. They're good people and sometimes they're more like family than your family is.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But the rest of them? Fuck them and fuck what they think of you. Don't assume because they're in charge that they know better than you how to live your life. They're just as confused as you are. One of the great secrets of adulthood is that you don't figure everything out. You just figure out how to make it look like you have.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">That goes for your parents, too. Here's another secret: your parents are just people too. They don't have all the answers. And no, they probably don't understand you now. When people have children, they secretly believe that their kids are going to be exactly like them, except that they won't make the same mistakes. When it turns out that this new person you've created is just that, a person, with their own minds and souls and ways of thinking and wants and needs, that might be completely 180º from what you want -- a lot of people can't deal with that.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">That sucks, but you know what? That's not your fault, either. They need to learn to accept who you are and to accept the choices you make. Maybe it'll take them a while -- not everybody's a quick study -- but most of the time, they do figure it out eventually.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And if they don't, then fuck them. Most cool people I know <em>make</em> their own families out of friends and lovers. If your parents can't accept you, you just have to understand that and build a family out of the people who do. You'll find them.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">I wish I could tell you there was another way to get through all of this, but there's not. You're stuck with this bullshit, kid, right up until the day you get that diploma and bounce the fuck on out of wherever it is the universe started you off -- the burbs or the hood or some sad little cowshit town out in the middle of Flyover Country. But from there, you can go anywhere. <em>Anywhere</em>. Sometimes you get to do it in style; you've got the grades to go to a kick-ass college and study whatever you want, or parents who can pay to see your dreams realized. If you've got that chance, take it.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">If that's not the case -- if you're not bound for Harvard or MIT or UCLA -- you can still get out. Nobody's got a chain around your ankle. Sometimes salvation looks like a Greyhound bus, headed to New York or San Francisco or Portland or Denver. That's not easy, but it can be done. Plenty of people do it and do well.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">I won't bullshit you: it's rough out here in the big world. It is. The stakes are higher. You can die out here, get killed, disappear, lose yourself to a bottle or a needle or a pipe. And people like us, who make our own way in the world, often find ourselves in places we'd rather not be, because we're not following the easy, well-defined path.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But you can make it. And Dan Savage is right: <em>it gets better</em>. It does. I swear to you, kid, it gets better. You make friends. You fall in love. You become master of your own destiny, wherever the world takes you and wherever you decide to go.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And one day, you'll find yourself over thirty, looking at the life you've made -- a life you probably couldn't have even imagined back in the day, back in school -- and all the horror and hate and terror will seem like a bad dream that somebody else had. You won't be that scared person anymore.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And that's when you've won.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">My heart breaks for you, kid, and what you're going through. You may not believe that, but it's true. It breaks for you and every other kid like you, like me, like <em>us</em>. It breaks for every kid who takes a beatdown because of how they dress or how they think or who they love. As a wise man once wrote, \"What I hope most of all is that you understand what I mean when I tell you that though I do not know you and even though I may never meet you, laugh with you, cry with you, or kiss you, I love you. With all my heart, I love you.\"</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">All I can do is repeat myself: it gets better. It gets better. <em>It gets better</em>. You will be beautiful and you will be amazing. You will be loved, you will be admired, you will have people to share your dreams and your life with. You will win.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And fuck anybody who tells you otherwise.</p></p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Get to it.</p></p>",

                "content": "<p><p>I don't post here much very often these days, mainly thanks to Twitter. (I also haven't really felt like I had much to say, this past year or so.) Twitter is quick and simple, and unlike a blog post, I don't really have to think about what I'm trying to express. (Not that I have to do that with a blog post, but I'd rather write something coherent than not.)<br /><br />Twitter has become my dominant Net experience these days. For years, my day began with Google Reader. I'd open it up and surf through my feeds, my equivalent of picking up the <em>Times</em>. But nowadays, I hit Twitter first, starting with the newest tweets and working my way backwards to the last tweets I saw. Only then do I go over to Reader -- or, more often, <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/\">Reeder</a>, the iPhone Reader app I picked up a while back based on <a href=\"http://www.warrenellis.com\">Warren's</a> recommendation.<br /><br />Alan Watts once <a href=\"http://ask.metafilter.com/116609/Alan-Watts-Quotations\">said something along the lines</a> that each of us is a node through which the universe looks at itself. That's what Twitter feels like: watching the universe watch itself through different eyes. It's a way of immersing oneself in the collective experiencing of a given moment, in a much more immediate way than reading structured news or even blog posts. You open Twitter and you see what a thousand people are doing at any given moment. It's like a downmarket version of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_X\">Professor Xavier</a>'s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebro\">Cerebro</a>. It's instant and ephemeral (no matter whether it's <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CBcQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Fepicenter%2F2010%2F04%2Floc-google-twitter%2F&amp;ei=v1FgTOjWMpKCsQO79PSpCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFYzhOyUTKyyP8jWC5Or03J13NCxg\">archived</a> or not).<br /><br />Twitter, for me at least, belies the notion that mediated networks are isolating. I feel more connected to the world around me with Twitter than I did before -- particularly as I get older and my face-to-face relationships with people become less constant and more scattered, as my friends get married or work jobs that keep them from socializing constantly and as I myself undergo that natural withdrawal that happens when you reach your thirties and no longer feel the constant need to expand your social circle. And yet, my circle <em>is</em>&nbsp;expanding, with every new day and every new person I follow on Twitter and who follows me. I probably spend more time talking to my Twitter friends than I do to my local friends (and often I talk to <em>them</em>&nbsp;via Twitter).<br /><br />Maybe that sounds sad, but I don't feel that way. It makes me happy. And perhaps it would be different if I lived in a different city. Las Vegas is a terribly isolating place, both socially and environmentally. When it's 110&ordm; outside and you can get third-degree burns from putting your hands on the wheel of your car, <em>nobody</em>&nbsp;wants to leave the house to congregate. The fact that I don't drink often anymore is also isolating, as Las Vegas is a city whose socializing is predicated entirely upon alcohol.<br /><br />Which makes me think that what I'm really trying to say is that I ought to get out of here.</p></p>",

            "source": {
                "content": "<p>So I'd like your advice, my dear Internet.</p><p></p><p>I have a software project called <a href=\"http://www.dbasr.com\"><strong>dbasr</strong></a> that I've been working on for a while -- several years, on and off, in fact. Weirdly enough, it's actually probably more relevant and useful now than when I started it.</p><p></p><p>I've rewritten the code base several times, but I think I'm on the final  iteration for a beta release now. There's nothing really to look at unless you're a coder, but I'm literally working on building the UI right now.</p><p></p><p>I've been keeping the exact nature of it under wraps, because I wanted to simply drop it on the world. Not that it's a secret -- I've told a few people about it -- but I'd like to be the first to market with it. (I can tell you it's a combination of a web application and a service. If you know me and my interests, you might be able to fill in some gaps from that.)</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, it's a pretty substantial project for one person, and the reason I haven't finished it is because real life intrudes. It's a lot of code and a lot of UI design and there aren't enough hours in the day. I've tried to get other people on board, but understandably nobody's been particularly willing to invest themselves into a project with no immediate paycheck.</p><p></p><p>I've talked to a few people I know about securing investment money -- going the traditional angel-funding route. But after a lot of consideration, I'm not sure I see the point of doing so. I don't need a lot of money -- really just enough to pay my expenses while I finish writing the software, and a very little bit of hardware and running costs.</p><p></p><p>I also don't trust anyone else to run this. My experience tells me that if I get money from angels or VCs, they'll expect to direct the company's business decisions, and I don't think that's a good idea in this case. In fact, the reason that <strong>dbasr</strong> is such a unique concept is not because I'm necessarily that smart, but because everyone who's ever tried anything similar has ended up letting money people make the decisions on how it ought to work. I won't do that.</p><p></p><p>I keep looking at tools like Kickstarter and Indie Go Go, which several people I know have successfully used to fund projects, and I'm thinking about using one of these for <strong>dbasr</strong>. Doing so means telling the world what it is and committing myself to a particular set of features, but I'm probably okay with that right now.</p><p></p><p>What I'm afraid of is somebody else running with the idea. In this case, I think it's a cool enough idea that I'd be happy to simply see it out there...but I'd also like to make some money from it, and I think I've figured out ways to do that which are completely non-evil.</p><p></p><p>I've run the numbers and done my homework and I don't think I can reasonably expect to get super-rich off of it, but I do think it will be profitable pretty quickly and make me enough money to live comfortably, and possibly expand into a thriving little business. \"Little\" being the key here. It doesn't need to be a megacorporation. It's a simple software platform that can be maintained by a small team, maybe even just me by myself to start.</p><p></p><p>I think it's a tool that could seriously affect the way a certain subset of business in the world is done. Certainly the people who know about it have all seemed enthusiastic.</p><p></p><p>Look, whether you like me or not or think I'm a windbag, you have to admit something: I'm good at understanding where holes in the market exist. I'm neither capable nor interested in filling most of them; when I came up with an idea for an augmented reality device in 2003, I ditched it because I didn't have the faintest idea of how to actually <em>build</em> something like that, even though I had most of the broad strokes of an iPhone in mind (digital compass and GPS with gyroscope, camera on opposite side of screen).</p><p></p><p>But this hole I can fill. And it might change the world, at least in a little way. It won't cure cancer or feed starving children or teach Beyond Petroleum how to build an oil rig...but it's pretty goddamned cool, nonetheless.</p><p></p><p>So here's my question to you: do I go for it? Do I make some UI mockups, set up a Kickstarter fund, ask for money, share my idea with the world even though it's not even ready for internal testing? Or do I keep soldiering away?</p><p></p><p>If I could just work on this 8-10 hours a day, without having to worry about paying rent, I'd have it done in just a few months. And it would be amazing.</p><p></p><p>Tell me what you think, in the comments here or on my Twitter <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/jzellis\">@jzellis</a>.</p>",

            "source": {
                "content": "<p>Dear BP's PR department:</p><p></p><p>First of all, let's get one thing very, very clear before we go any further: your company has fucked up. Not \"made a regrettable error\" or \"inadvertently\" anything. You have caused a massive unnatural disaster. Right now, pretty much everybody on the planet hates your guts. There are guys in caves in Afghanistan with Osama bin Laden, sitting around a radio playing the BBC World Service, going \"Dude, seriously, fuck BP.\"</p><p></p><p>I can't imagine there's anybody who doesn't actually sit on your board of directors who doesn't want to kick your asses right now. And by \"you\", I mean \"everybody who works for BP, including the PR department, the receptionists and probably the janitorial staff\".</p><p></p><p>So, now that we've got that out of the way....</p><p></p><p>I understand that it is your job to try and make BP's relations with the public as optimal as possible. You want the public to love your company, to want to consume your products and make everybody a lot of money. You do this, by and large, by figuring out ways to make BP look like the coolest, most environmentally-conscious company in the world. This is a very difficult thing to do when you're dumping gazillions of gallons of death sauce into the Gulf of Mexico. So you're probably very busy right now.</p><p></p><p>One thing you might want to do, however, is to recognize that you're going to have to ignore one of the basic tenets of public relations: what I mean is, <em>you have to admit you're wrong</em>. Really, really wrong. Like, the only thing you could have done that was worse was to basically just light the fucking planet on fire while raping babies.</p><p></p><p>You also need to admit that you were completely careless and ignored your own engineers, who told you this was probably going to happen. You also ignored the fact that your oil well starting actually falling apart like Lindsey Lohan on a mescaline margarita in March, which might have alerted you to a problem.</p><p></p><p>We know why you did. You're a corporation. Your job is to make money. And you were afraid you were going to not make as much money if you stopped and actually built an oil well that could actually do the job it was intended for. Let me underline that: there was never, ever any chance you'd lose money on this. You just might have made <em>less</em> money in the short term.</p><p></p><p>Look: you sell petroleum. You sell the one thing that every nation on the planet is willing to go to war to possess. You're like Nino Brown in <em>New Jack City</em>, if the entire world was Chris Rock. You're our momma, you're our daddy, you're our nigga in the alley. You're our <a href=\"http://www.lyricsdownload.com/curtis-mayfield-pusherman-lyrics.html\">pusherman</a>.</p><p></p><p>The worst that might have happened was that you spent a few million dollars shoring up the <em>Deepwater Horizon</em>, and then you would have gone on making lots more money because it wouldn't have blown the fuck up. As far as the world is concerned, the only good thing about this spill is that every barrel of that oil is one less barrel you can make a profit on. You're losing billions of dollars here.</p><p></p><p>Not that anybody feels sorry for you on that account, so don't try that tack. It won't work. In fact, there's only really one strategy that will be at all effective in saving your company from a planet-wide boycott and bad press the likes of which the world hasn't seen since Adolf and Eva did their William Tell routine in the bunker in 1945.</p><p></p><p>It's very simple. It will work. Nobody will like you, but at least they won't hate you to the point where they might actually pressure their governments into hounding you into bankruptcy and madness.</p><p></p><p>Just write a letter. I will even draft it for you. It needs to read something like this:</p><p></p><p><em>Dear Earth,</em></p><p></p><p><em>We fucked up. Badly. Very badly. We are completely and utterly horrified by what has happened. Every time we think of what our company's greed for profit and carelessness has caused, we run to the toilet and puke. We drink a lot these days. Every time we see another picture of an oil-covered bird, we think about doing a full-on Jonestown thing here at BP HQ. Just put the toxin in the air vents and pump it into every office so we don't have to live with the total horror and guilt for the incredibly awful thing that we specifically have caused to happen. Not to mention the people who died on the rig. That makes us sick whenever we look at ourselves in a mirror, which is why we've had all mirrors and reflective surfaces removed from BP HQ until this all gets resolved. We just can't look at ourselves.</p><p></em></p><p></p><p><em>We have no excuses. We have no spin. We take full responsibility for this spill. It was our fault, nobody else's. It was a completely avoidable accident, and we let it happen because we didn't really give a shit. We figured that there was a pretty good chance this wouldn't happen. We were so incredibly wrong. We are thoughtless and careless and greedy. We are grubby little pigs rooting at the teat of 21st century capitalism.</em></p><p></p><p><em>Here's what we're going to do to fix this problem: whatever it takes, whatever it costs, as quickly as possible. We are not going to try and save our own equipment or our revenue stream from this oil well, if doing so means that a single extra gallon of this shit burbles up into the Gulf. We know we're simply going to take a massive loss here. We don't care. Plugging that hole is our first priority. Everything else we do, all our business, comes second to this.</em></p><p></p><p><em>And once we finally do that, we're going to spend as many billions of dollars as it takes to clean up our incredibly massive mess. We don't put a limit on how much we want to earn, so we're not going to put a limit on how much we're going to spend. We're going to usher in a new century of corporate responsibility.</em></p><p></p><p><em>In return, we hope that you understand that we fucked up, and that we're going to do better in the future. We're not going to cut corners, we're going to be careful, and we're going to keep bringing you this substance that you all rely on in a safe and ethical fashion. We hope that if we can make you truly believe that we're doing everything we can, you might still buy our product.</em></p><p></p><p><em>Your friends,</p><p>Beyond Petroleum</em></p><p></p><p>So, uh, yeah. I'd go with something like that.</p>",

You don't want the couscous they sell at Wal-Mart, the kind where the actual couscous bits are tiny like Malt-O-Meal. You want the kind where each individual couscou or whatever you call them are about the size of the pellets you load in a pellet gun, the kind you shoot vermin with. You can buy this at any reputable Mediterranean market. Look for places with names like \"Marrakech\" or \"Abdul's Market\".</p><p></p><p>Once you've obtained this, continue with the recipe. Go ahead. I'll be waiting.</p><p></p><p>[...]</p><p></p><p>Ready?</p><p></p><p>Okay, first you want to slice the Portobello caps into strips about 1/3\" - 1/2\" wide. Think of how you'd cut steak or chicken for fajitas. Like that. Then chop the onion into rings and cut the rings in half. Finally, cut the red pepper into thinner strips.</p><p></p><p>Now, here's the thing with the barbecue sauce -- once you've got the Worcestershire, the tomato and the brown sugar, the rest is basically to taste. Throw it in a bowl and mix it thoroughly. It isn't rocket science. Mix things until it tastes good to you. If it's too thick, add a little more vinegar or Worcestershire. Balsamic vinegar is the Auto-Tune of cooking. It makes everything lovely.</p><p></p><p>Get a saucepan. Put it on medium high heat. Put the butter in it. When the butter is melted and sizzling, put the couscous in it. Yes, I'm serious. Sauté the couscous a bit, making sure to shift it around so you get all the sides of the little balls. When you feel you've accomplished this to a reasonable degree, pour in the two cups of chicken broth and cover it. Turn it to medium heat and let it cook. It will be done when the water is gone and the couscous is soft like rice.</p><p></p><p>Now that you've done this, take a big cast iron pan and put some olive oil in it. Put it on medium high heat as well. When the oil is all thin and shifty, throw the mushrooms, onions and red peppers in it. You want to sauté this stuff fairly well.</p><p></p><p>When it's nice and sautéed, pour the barbecue sauce into the cast iron pan and mix everything around so it's covered with sauce. Here's the weird part -- <em>raise</em> the temperature to high.</p><p></p><p>What will happen is that the sauce will begin to caramelize around the veggies. <em>Be vigilant here</em>. If you burn it, it will suck. Watch it the way you'd watch a junkie around your jewelry collection.</p><p></p><p>When it's nice and thick and caramelized, turn off the heat and remove the cast iron skillet. The couscous ought to be done by this time, or pretty close.</p><p></p><p>When the couscous <em>is</em> done, take a big ladle and put a pile of it on your plate. Then take a big wide spoon and pour the barbecue sauce and veggies on top of it, like you would put spaghetti sauce on spaghetti.</p><p></p><p>Put a dollop of yogurt on top. Repeat for each diner in your party.</p><p></p><p>Enjoy.</p>",

            "source": {
                "content": "<p>I've started writing (which, since I use computers, also means \"recording\") the second Red State Soundsystem album, which will probably either be called <em>SPQR</em> or <em>The Big Darkness</em> or possibly <em>Senatus Populus Que Red State Soundsystem</em>. (Probably not, though. But maybe.)<br /><br />As a songwriter, one of the biggest problems I have is getting over my abject horror of being pretentious. My inner Colin Meloy is constantly getting the shit kicked out of him by my inner Iggy Pop. \"But I want to write songs about Ada Lovelace!\" says Colin. \"Shut the fuck up and write some ROCK AND ROLL, YOU FUCKIN' PUSSY!\" says Iggy, and gives him a Glasgow kiss. So I always end up somewhere in between -- as my buddy Alex points out, I mainly write midtempo gloomy shit.<br /><br />It's scary, though, to go for the grandiose stuff, because you run the risk of just looking like an asshole. (Freak-folk people, I'm <em>so</em> looking at you right now.) But the response to the first album has been pretty good, critically if not necessarily financially. So I'm feeling a bit encouraged to let my more baroque tendencies take hold.<br /><br />And so we have a bunch of new songs: \"SPQR\", which is a Pogues/Gogol Bordello sort of track about a bastard of a Roman soldier; \"Entropy\" which is a sneering electro track sung from the perspective of Lucifer (\"Where were you when the world was made? I was still drunk from the night before\"); \"702\" which is about living in Las Vegas and how tourists all suck the big fat hairy sweaty cock; you get the picture. I've even got one song I'm playing around with that deals with a star-crossed love affair from the point of view of the man's dog. And I'm orbiting the idea of the Ada Lovelace song, because I love her.<br /><br />I'm also going to be including final versions of a few songs I've been kicking around the Net for a long time: \"After The Ice Age\", \"Invisible\" and \"Country Dress\" will almost certainly be on the album, as will \"The Big Darkness\", which I've tried in a couple of permutations but never actually released. After this, I don't have any more old songs at all; future albums will all be new stuff.<br /><br />(If it seems like I'm recycling, well, consider this: most of the songs from most bands' first couple of albums are made up of songs they've written long before. I just threw stuff out on the Net rather than waiting to collect it. And as Elvis Costello once said, you've got twenty-five years to write your first album and six months to write the follow-up.)<br /><br />Musically, it's probably going to be even <em>more</em> eclectic and all over the place than <em>Ghosts In A Burning City</em>. I'm not interested in making an album of songs that sound alike; I'm interested in writing whatever the fuck I feel like writing, and in this case that's electronic and country and world beat and chamber music all mixed up. If that turns you off -- if you like the comfort of knowing that all the tracks on the record are gonna sound like the Big Hit Single (except the inevitable One Slow Song), may I suggest you pick up the new Interpol album?<br /><br />We're considering setting up a Kickstarter project to help fund the recording. We need some new gear for this one; <a href=\"http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/AlphaChan/\">a good microphone preamp</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/828MkIIusb/\">new recording interface</a> for starters, an upgrade to Ableton Live 8, other refinements. In return, we're thinking about offering Kickstarters access to a private making-of blog, some sort of video diary, and free copies of the album and other stuff (b-sides, remixes, etc.) when it comes out. We'd basically like to do this one in public, and get some money for it.<br /><br />We may still release the <em>Indie Rock Is Easy</em> EP I've mentioned on Twitter, though we'll probably just drop it for free on the Red State website. If we do, that will include a cover of the Big Friendly Corporation's \"LOL\" and a secret song that I can't talk about except that it's going to have a special guest vocalist and it will make <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieron_Gillen\">Kieron Gillen</a> giggle.<br /><br />So know you know as much as I do.</p>",

(For example, I recorded <a href=\"http://tylerc.com/120minutes/archive-1986-1995.php#072692\">this show</a> from the summer of 1992 and dubbed it onto a C90 cassette tape by holding my little boombox with the built-in microphone up to the TV's speaker.

In point of fact, I still do that, actually.)<br /><br />A lot of people who bitch about how MTV doesn't play videos anymore seem to have conveniently forgotten what MTV was <em>actually</em> like in the days before <em>The Real World</em> and <em>Road Rules</em>. It was completely full of horrible, shitty, disposable shlock back then too; it's just that the shlock was musical rather than reality-televisual in nature.<br /><br />The first time I saw the video for Nirvana's\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", it was buried in a block of videos from acts like Poison, Guns 'n' Roses, MC Hammer, The New Kids On The Block, Extreme, Mr. Big and C+C Music Factory. Despite the fact that bands like The Pixies, Public Enemy, The Smiths, De La Soul, Nirvana, Mudhoney, and The Happy Mondays were all putting out records and videos at the time, you were far more likely to see the video for Right Said Fred's \"I'm Too Sexy\" or Extreme's execrable slow jam \"More Than Words\" every half-hour than \"Here Comes Your Man\" or \"Bigmouth Strikes Again\" or \"Me, Myself And I\".<br /><br />(I particularly remember that grating month or so when MTV played Guns 'n' Roses' incredibly pompous, idiotic, tedious, endless video for \"November Rain\" <em>quite literally </em>every hour and a half. I think they only stopped when the UN issued some sort of proclamation on the use of media as torture.)<br /><br />For the first few years of its existence, <em>120 Minutes</em> was  produced and hosted by a fellow named Dave Kendall, and it's hard  not to see the show as uniquely a product of Kendall's taste and  choices; why else the constant playing of videos by relatively obscure British acts like The Wonder Stuff and World Party and XTC, as well as industrial groups like Severed Heads and Skinny Puppy who couldn't get within a light year of MTV's constant rotation?<br /><br />But this is precisely what gave the show its value; a great part of the charm of <em>120 Minutes</em> was that it didn't focus on a specific genre or style of music; rather, the playlists seemed to be based on Whatever Dave Kendall Thought Was Cool At The Moment. For example, check out this playlist from January 1991:<br /><ul><br /><li>Happy Mondays \"Step On\"</li><br /><li> Iggy Pop \"Candy\"</li><br /><li>The House of Love \"I Don't Know Why I Love You\"</li><br /><li>The Stone Roses \"Fool's Gold\"</li><br /><li>The Pixies \"Dig For Fire/Allison\"</li><br /><li>Cocteau Twins \"Iceblink Luck\"</li><br /><li>The Jesus and Mary Chain \"Head On\"</li><br /><li>Nine Inch Nails \"Head Like A Hole\"</li><br /><li>World Party \"Way Down Now\"</li><br /><li>The Soup Dragons \"I'm Free\"</li><br /><li>Concrete Blonde \"Joey\"</li><br /><li>The Cure \"Never Enough\"</li><br /><li>Midnight Oil \"Blue Sky Mine\"</li><br /><li>The Charlatans UK \"The Only One I Know\"</li><br /><li>The Sundays \"Here's Where The Story Ends\"</li><br /><li>Sonic Youth \"Cool Thing\"</li><br /><li>Sinead O'Connor \"Nothing Compares 2 U\"</li><br /><li>Peter Murphy \"Cuts You Up\"</li><br /><li>Jane's Addiction \"Been Caught Stealing\"</li><br /><li>Depeche Mode \"Enjoy The Silence\"</li><br /></ul><br />That's a fairly genre-busting little romp through the world of alternative pop circa 1991: you've got Madchester, light industrial, wall o' noise, gloom pop, East Coast alternarock, psychedelia, and, er, Iggy Pop.<br /><br />Pandora and Last.fm would never generate this playlist: the bands and songs contained within it have very little in common, except that they're not mainstream music. But it's still obviously <em>an intentional set of items</em>; anybody who knows the history of pop music would look at this and nod their heads and recognize it as a reasonable and coherent collection.<br /><br />You can say the same of any random playlist of Santa Monica public radio station KCRW's legendary<a href=\"http://www.kcrw.com/music/programs/mb\"> <em>Morning Becomes Eclectic</em></a> show, which is a sort of Apollonian audio-only version of <em>120 Minutes </em>geared at Angelenos with refined musical sensibilities. These days, those playlists are designed by <em>MBE</em> host Jason Bentley, who used to be the soundtrack supervisor for <em>Six Feet Under</em>.<br /><br />Bentley and Kendall (who's still working, so far as I know) are <em>subjective curators</em> of music; they provide unique, individualized filters for music. You either like what they like, or you don't; but if you do, they serve as nodal points for finding new stuff you wouldn't find otherwise.<br /><br />Algorithms can't, as of yet, find <em>cool</em>; there's no objective connection between The House Of Love and Nine Inch Nails. It takes a Dave Kendall to find it. And that was why <em>120 Minutes</em> was so amazing...and the fact that MTV ditched it years ago says pretty much everything you need to know about the state of <em>that</em> particular cable channel.</p>",

They defy the current notion that rock and roll songs should be about, y'know, <em>whatever you want them to be about</em>. Every song on their first full-length album <em>American Demo</em> was a thesis, a statement of purpose from the band's principal songwriters and vocalists, Simon and Julia Indelicate. And the same holds true of <a href=\"http://corporaterecords.co.uk/artists/The+Indelicates/Songs+For+Swinging+Lovers/\"><em>Songs For Swinging Lovers</em></a>, their second album, released yesterday via their new net label, <a href=\"http://corporaterecords.co.uk/\">Corporate Records</a>. (More about that in a moment.) It's a polemic against stupidity, complacency and venality as it exists in Great Britain circa 2010. And it's very, very clever -- another adjective that doesn't get bandied about often these days.<br /><br />It was clear with <em>American Demo</em> that The Indelicates were acolytes at the temple of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Haines\">Luke Haines</a> and his various projects (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Auteurs\">The Auteurs</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Box_Recorder_(band)\">Black Box Recorder</a>); while that's still evident here, they also move into more expansive sonic territory, channeling Brecht, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village_Green_Preservation_Society\"><em>Village Green</em></a>-era Kinks and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_the_Unstoppable_Sex_Machine\">Carter The Unstoppable Machine</a> in equal measure. Much of the band's distinctive sound is formed by the back-and-forth between Julia's lovely and almost formal soprano and Simon's rasping, sneering baritone, which recalls Haines and Carter USM's Jim Bob Morrison. In terms of production, <em>Songs</em> is a bit more ambitious than <em>American Demo</em>, and it pays off. All of the members are extremely competent musicians, and every song is arranged with the care of a film score. It would be interesting, though, to hear the band expand upon their sound a bit -- to mine slightly more exotic territory.<br /><br />Really, though, the highlight of <em>Songs For Swinging Lyrics</em> are the vicious, cruel and utterly hilarious lyrics, credited to both Simon and Julia. These aren't feel-good tunes, unless (like me) you're the kind of person who would be cheerful at the burning of Rome. \"Hey doc, take a knife to me, scar my snatch into a smile,\" sings Julia on \"Flesh\". \"Strip me and dissect me, take my tears and tap my bile...Beauty isn't truth, it's just youth and it's adaptive, and it's elastic.\" This is confrontational music, asking questions and rubbing the listener's nose (or ears) in the hideousness of the world we've made.<br /><br />There isn't really a context for The Indelicates right now. Indie music is in love with the superficial now, with the pure pop masterpiece. <em>Songs For Swinging Lovers</em> is pop music on its surface, but it's not anything The Kids are going to be dancing to in the discos any time soon. Not that The Indelicates mind -- <a href=\"http://indelicates.com/index.php?p=lyrics&amp;s=kids\">they hate the kids</a>. They seem less interested in making tons of money and getting on MTV than in using their considerable talent to start cultural fires.<br /><br />One of those fires, in fact, is aimed at the traditional record industry. The Indelicates have created a net label called Corporate Records, which any band can use as a platform for releasing their own work, for whatever price they choose. You can buy <em>Songs For Swinging Lovers</em> from Corporate for whatever you feel the album is worth.<br /><br />This is a divisive sort of record. You'll either love it or hate it. And I suspect that's just the way The Indelicates like it.</p>",

So this guy Nick Starr posts <a href=\"http://twitter.com/NickStarr\">a series of suicidal posts to Twitter</a>, culminating in <a href=\"http://twitter.com/NickStarr/statuses/181416762\">this one</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote>alright this is it. Parked my car. I wish everyone who ever was nice to me well. See you in the next life</blockquote><br /><br />This leads a <a href=\"http://www.metafilter.com/63598/Where-is-Nick-Starr\">a few people</a> to wonder if he's actually alive or not, or if Twitter has hosted its first suicide note. A few days later, his friend <a href=\"http://dawnanddrewwp.podshow.com/dnds_bb/viewtopic.php?p=222905#222905\">posts that he's alive and kicking</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote>Drew and I just got off the phone with Nick Starr. He is ok and is getting help. He thanks everyone for all their positive well wishes and asks that you will respect his privacy right now as he works through a difficult time. </blockquote><br /><br />I'm sorry. His <i>what</i>?<br /><br />Personally, I've dealt with deep and chronic depression my entire life. I've done some deeply stupid and embarrassing things because of it. But even at my absolute worst, I've never even felt the urge to <i>post my pathetic, failed suicide attempts on fucking Twitter</i>. Christ, at my <i>most</i> miserable, I've never posted a \"Goodbye, cruel world\" blog post -- because a) deep down I know better than to off my stupid self, and even if I <i>didn't</i>, b) I have a little more respect and concern for the people who <i>do</i> care about me than to inform them of my leap into the infinite via a fucking content management system. Suicide notes are bad enough. A suicide <i>post</i> -- Christ, what a twat.<br /><br />And then, when he decides he doesn't want to get his Hart Crane on after all, this prick asks everyone to respect his <i>privacy</i>?  He wants the whole world to read the tragic decay of his crumbling psyche via the deep and meaningful medium of <i>Twitter</i> -- which is like crack for the sort of terminally self-obsessed and narcissistic assholes who really think anybody outside their sex partners and their mommies give a shit about their moment-to-moment movements -- and then, when he realizes he actually wants to live...<i>now</i> he wants to go through his dark night of the soul with a little privacy and dignity?<br /><br />Fuck off, boyo. You acted like a prick. It's okay -- it happens, God knows I've done it more times than I can count -- and I do honestly empathize with anyone going through this particular hell. I have been there, so many times.<br /><br />But have the goddamn sack to pull out your little futurephone and post a little sumthin'-sumthin'. Maybe \"Hey, I'm alright, I was having a fucked up time, I'm sorry I worried everybody. Drinks are on me next time.\" Take some responsibility for your actions. I've had to make that phone call more than once. \"Hey, dude, sorry I turned into Ian Curtis last night. Thanks for talking me down.\" It happens if you're a depressive person. And the people who care about you will understand, provided you show even the slightest concern for <i>their</i> feelings. Don't leave 'em hanging. (No pun intended.)<br /><br />(Of course, it might just be that nobody really gives a fuck about this guy. After all, he was pretty much Twittering his whole suicide twitch for at least a couple of hours beforehand. He even mentions a place to do it from. You'd think somebody might have shown up at the bridge with a six pack and a shoulder to cry on. Maybe that's what actually happened, I dunno.)<br /><br />More and more, all of these social apps just make me sick to my stomach. There's too much forced intimacy, and <i>way</i> too much information going around about things that ought to remain private and secret. I don't want to know these things about the people around me.<br /><br />And you have my promise, world -- no matter how absolutely shitty and hideous the world gets, I will never off myself and inform you of it via the Internet. Scout's honor.</p>",

                "content": "<p>1. People <em>are</em> willing to buy online music via PayPal from your website.<br /><br />2. Not all of these people are my mom. Or actually people I know. This is encouraging.<br /><br />3. Not having a label or distributor means the music goes directly into my PayPal account. No quarterly reports, no sending my boys to the label accounting office with shotguns and slide rulers to make sure I'm getting my full 6.7% of wholesale revenue. Which brings me to...<br /><br />4. I'm getting roughly 95% of the revenue for the album, minus PayPal's cut. This means that I have now earned more from album sales than, say, U2 did until at least <em>The Unforgettable Fire</em> and possibly <em>Pop</em>. (That was a joke. U2 probably got royalty checks after <em>War</em>.)<br /><br />5. If you keep 95% of your revenue, and ten people buy your album at $9.99 every day, it's entirely feasible for you to actually <em>do this for a living</em>. (Assuming you have more than ten friends, and that new people keep buying your album, and that you also keep making new things for people to buy.)<br /><br />6. Uploading MP3s to every possible site whose URL ends in .fm is exhausting.<br /><br />7. Promoting via Twitter and Facebook seems to work fairly well, but I'm not sure it's enough.<br /><br />8. Magazines want physical copies of your CD to review. I suspect that sending them a burned CD in a paper sleeve with the words 'REVIEW THIS, MOTHERFUCKER' is probably not a way to gain their positive attention. Therefore, I'm probably going to burn a hundred or so to a) sell to people who don't buy music online, b) send to reviewers, and c) sell at any live shows.<br /><br />9. Even people you know, by and large, don't mind paying for the album you spent hundred of hours over several years and made them listen to rough mixes of and bored them to tears talking about. This is quite wonderful to discover.<br /><br />10. Some of the people you know will swear they'll buy the album the second it comes out, right up to the second it comes out. Then they will not buy it. Not everybody is sitting around waiting with bated breath to buy your album. It might take some of them a few days, or a week, or a month. Some of them won't buy it at all. Do not take this personally.<br /><br />11. Publications are also not waiting with bated breath for your self-produced, self-released album to come out so that they can write rapturous reviews of it and make you rich. You have to put together a press release, press photos, etc.<br /><br />12. I can't figure out a way to do press photos of myself without actually being in them. So I'm either going to do a lot of speed for a month or find a photographer who knows how to hide chub from the lens.<br /><br />13. Buying a cup of coffee and a <em>Buffy The Vampire Slayer</em> comic with money you've earned from selling your album is one of the best feelings ever.</p>",

                "content": "<p>So apparently a group of musicians in England called the Featured Artists Coalition have voted to support a \"three strikes\" law against illegal file downloaders: get caught three times and have your bandwidth reduced to a point where you can no longer download big files. It has <a href=\"http://lyingtothekids.blogspot.com/2009/10/via-akirathedon-full-post-at-from.html\">not met with enthusiasm from the British blogosphere</a>. Signatories to this support document include Steve Jones (presumably the one from the Sex Pistols), Annie Lennox, David Gilmour and Nick Mason of Pink Floyd, Tjinder Singh from Cornershop, Ed O'Brien from Radiohead, Patrick Wolf, George Michael, and Billy Bragg, who is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJfgsG9Wgas\">not exactly known for his rabid capitalism</a>.<br /><br />Interestingly, this comes on the heels of a blog post by Amanda Palmer, who's become a sort of poster child for DIY Internet promotion for musicians. Entitled <a href=\"http://blog.amandapalmer.net/post/200582690/why-i-am-not-afraid-to-take-your-money-by-amanda\">\"Why I Am Not Afraid To Take Your Money, By Amanda Fucking Palmer\"</a>, the blog details Palmer's happy willingness to be shameless in her requests for cash from fans. A quote (orthography is hers):<br /><blockquote>listen.<br /><br />artists need to make money to eat and to continue to make art.<br /><br />artists used to rely on middlemen to collect their money on their behalf, thereby rendering themselves innocent of cash-handling in the public eye.<br /><br />artists will now be coming straight to you (yes YOU, you who want their music, their films, their books) for their paychecks.<br />please welcome them. please help them. please do not make them feel badly about asking you directly for money.<br />dead serious: this is the way shit is going to work from now on and it will work best if we all embrace it and don’t fight it.</blockquote><br />Though they are saying it in vastly different ways (and with vastly different responses from their audiences), the core of what the FAC and Palmer are saying is the same: musicians need to be paid for their efforts.<br /><br />The traditional model, as Palmer points out, is this: artist signs to a record label, who fronts them the money to record and tour and in return collects the profits from sales of the artist's recordings, keeping the vast majority. This is increasingly no longer true, for two reasons:<br /><ul><br /><li>File-sharing is making it increasingly difficult to make money from selling music;</li><br /><li>Technology is making it easier for artists to make their own recordings and bring them directly to their audience.</li><br /></ul><br />I can't imagine that anybody in the world <em>really</em> thinks \"Fuck this band I love. I'm gonna steal their music and not pay them. I hope they fucking go bankrupt and live in cardboard boxes somewhere.\" Music sharing is <em>not</em> data piracy in the traditional sense -- where some prick starts selling bootlegged copies of an album without giving any of it to the artist or the label. Music sharing is about loving music.<br /><br />(It could be argued, though, that <em>somebody</em> makes a profit off of file-sharing: namely, the software companies who create file-sharing software and earn revenue from subscribers or advertisers. If that revenue isn't shared somehow with the artists (or, as they refer to such people in the Internet industry, \"content creators\") then I would say these companies are engaging in a form of piracy, and ought to have their asses handed to them, <em>so long as they're profiting off of the work of others without compensating those others</em>. This is where my problem with a lot of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-copyright\">copyfighters</a> comes in; they sound less like crusaders for the common good and more like shills for the software industry.)<br /><br />But here's the problem: musicians have, for the past century, <em>made their living from selling records</em>. There's no other model in place yet that really replaces that one, no model that allows musicians to devote themselves full-time to recording, releasing, promoting and touring to play their music. Amanda Palmer is experimenting with one, and it seems to be working for her right now, but only time will tell.<br /><br />The FAC \"three strikes\" idea is ludicrous, of course, and it's creating an incredible tide of ill-will towards them; on their website, commentators are comparing Bragg and other artists to slaves supporting their corporate masters. If one takes a deep breath and steps back, this of course is not true. In point of fact, a lot of the <a href=\"http://www.featuredartistscoalition.com/showscreen.php?site_id=161&amp;screentype=folder&amp;screenid=2984\">\"demands\" of the FAC</a> are the sort of thing that make record label executives reach for the Alka-Seltzer, including a \"use it or lose it\" provision in British copyright law that would require copyright holders to actively renew their claims or lose their copyrighted material to the public domain...not to mention demanding that artists who are signed to labels get paid when the label finds new technologies to sell the artists' work.<br /><br />I really don't believe that the FAC are a bunch of slavering fatcats lounging around on fainting couches made from the tanned skin of file-sharers, eating grapes and demanding that every penny be accounted for. I think they're a group of people who've spent their lives making music that lots of people claim to love, but don't want to reward them for creating. While some of them may not be fully aware of the fundamental changes that have occurred due to Internet file-sharing or the possibilities that are open to them, I find their \"three strikes\" notion more pitiable than infuriating.<br /><br />The people who <em>really</em> piss me off are the ones Amanda Palmer's addressing, who claim to be irritated by her requests for money. These people are beneath contempt. They're the ones who really want whatever they want, when they want it, and don't want to pay for it, and fuck you for asking. These are the people I'd cheerfully smash across the skull with a bottle.<br /><br />Being a musician is hard work. It takes time and effort to make music -- time and effort that ought to be rewarded somehow by the people who enjoy the results. Does anybody really disagree with this, in theory at least? If so, I'd love to hear a logical, well-thought-out objection to the idea that musicians -- like waitresses and law clerks and software developers and cab drivers -- should be paid for the work they do that benefits others.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_Allen#Social_activism\">Lily Allen</a> is not the problem here, though she seems to be the target of <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2009/09/26/dear-lily-allen/\">a great amount of vitriol</a>. After reading her thoughts on the subject (before she <a href=\"http://www.thetripwire.com/news/2009/09/24/its-not-alright-lily-allen-shuts-down-her-anti-piracy-blog/\">took her blog down</a>), I don't think she's some evil pop star diva; I think she and the group of people she's been talking to have come up with an untenable solution to an incredibly complicated and quite real problem that lots of very smart people have been devoting a lot of mental processing cycles to over the past decade or so. That doesn't make her the Devil, and treating her as such is simply childish.<br /><br />Not that it matters. I sometimes feel like absolutely no one with a voice in this discussion is interested in finding a reasonable, non-combative way to solve this problem in a way that makes life better both for musicians and for fans. Everybody wants to get up and rant about freedom or build imaginary file-sharing straw men. Maybe if people had been a bit more constructive in their conversations and willing to reach out to the other side, we wouldn't be faced with the FAC's silly demands and the blitzkreig of hatred it has engendered.<br /><br />All of this, of course, conveniently ignores the fact that file-sharing, like casual drug use, is still illegal in most jurisdictions; whether you agree with that illegality or not is essentially irrelevant until you figure out a way to change the laws where you live. If you live in a democracy, you have ways to change that, assuming you care enough to put your time and effort -- and probably money -- into actually changing the law, or at least supporting the people who are trying to do so.<br /><br />If not, then you're worse than the FAC could ever be. You're sitting on your couch shouting at people who are being proactive in this debate, even if you don't agree with their stance. You should probably shut up now.<br /><br />If you'd actually like to discuss these issues, feel free to leave your thoughts in the comments. If you want to talk seriously, I'll respond.</p>",

                "content": "<p>So I'm thinking about doing a video for \"Ghosts In A Burning City\", the title track for my album. The song is about chaos in the global South -- in my head, it's about Uganda, but it could really be applied to any place.<br /><br />I'd like to do a video for the track. The idea I have is this: a chest-mounted camera, facing at an actor's head (you can <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgiINDYhyTY\">see the trick I'm talking about here</a>), as the actor goes through a typical day in Las Vegas...except it's a feral Las Vegas, a Las Vegas that's like Darfur or Mogadishu, a burning city. The actor will dodge explosions, bullets, hide from warlords roaming the street. This won't be obvious immediately, but as the video goes on, things will descend into complete chaos. The end of the video, I think, will be the actor lying dead on Fremont Street, the victim of a bomb blast, the camera fixed on his/her open eyes.<br /><br />I think I can shoot this with an inexpensive HD camera like a Flip, and do most of the F/X work in post using AfterEffects. (I'm not an AfterEffects expert, but I think I'm capable of adding in matte scenery like smoke rising into the sky and explosions, etc.) I'm wondering about the logistics, though -- getting permission from the city to shoot, etc.<br /><br />If I can pull this off, I'd like to sell the video with the single as a download, with 60% of the profits going to <a href=\"http://www.invisiblechildren.com/\">Invisible Children</a>. (I'd donate 100%, but this will probably cost me money out of pocket, unless people are willing to donate time/equipment for me to use. And honestly, I'm not rich, and I can't really afford a few hundred bucks out of pocket.)<br /><br />Whaddya think? Does this sound interesting to you? If you're in Vegas, would you like to be involved somehow? Please let me know, either via the comments or via my Twitter account: (at)jzellis. I think this is kind of a cool idea. If I can do it without incurring a lot of cost, I would probably be willing to donate a higher percentage or all the profits. But I want to know what <em>you</em> think.</p>",

What it doesn't do -- <em>can't</em> do, until somebody figures out a way to digitize the dimensions of every building on the planet -- is take into consideration your <em>actual</em> physical space. To an AR app, the world is flat, and landmarks or points of interest are simply vectors.<br /><br />When you open Bionic Eye and point it around, it does what's advertised: it shows you badges for various points of interest like restaurants and coffee shops and tourist destinations. The app works perfectly well at this. The problem is that this information is rather pointless. If the POI is close enough for me to see it, I don't need the app in the first place; if it's not, simply knowing that there's a McDonald's somewhere in <em>that</em> general direction -- on the other side of that block of office buildings, or that stand of trees -- is not useful to me. More useful is the ability to see myself represented on an overhead map, with streets, and the location of the McDonalds as a point on the other end of a series of navigational instructions. This is, of course, technology we already have, and AR does not improve upon it in any useful way.<br /><br />[caption id=\"attachment_982\" align=\"aligncenter\"  caption=\"An extremely quickly mocked-up example of useful AR.\"]<a href=\"http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/arillus1.jpg\"><img title=\"arillus\" src=\"http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/arillus1.jpg\" /></a>[/caption]<br /><br />So what is augmented reality <em>actually</em> good for? Quite a lot, I think. Foremost in my mind, AR serves as a sort of hypertext for reality, providing context and depth. When I was playing with ideas about AR back in 2002-2003, the example I used to friends was: you're in New York. You see an interesting building. You hold up your AR device (which in my mind was a sort of hyper-PDA, at the time) and it tells you that this is the <a href=\"http://www.hotelchelsea.com/\">Chelsea Hotel</a>. It provides you with a set of hyperlinks to information that can be overlaid on top of what you're looking at -- the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Chelsea\">Wikipedia entry</a>, <a href=\"http://www.negroartist.com/ebay/nancyyyy.jpg\">photographs of Sid Vicious being led out by police</a> after (allegedly) murdering his girlfriend, links to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq745EJ06DY\">songs</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGfgMYfdBFc\">about</a> the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ype6Hw_Hmjo\">place</a>. In this way, your experience of this building in Manhattan is enriched, contextualized in interesting ways.<br /><br />Another example: perhaps you're thinking about going into that sushi place across the street. You point your AR device at it, and it gives you the menu with prices, a list of reviews, the phone number for the place so you can make reservations if necessary. A simple, elegant layer on top of your world.<br /><br />There are other, more obscure, but equally interesting uses. A device which can take pictures and store in them the location, direction and angle of the camera can be used to create 3D versions of physical locations, at a fraction of the processing power used by similar initiatives that utilize existing imaging technology. A wonderful toy might be an AR app that scans Flickr for other photographs taken from your location and angle and overlays them onto your screen, showing you a kind of animated collage of what your physical location has looked like over time. Those possibilities are endless.<br /><br />One application which completely fascinates me -- one that I've not heard anyone else mention before -- is the idea of AR as a medium for narrative storytelling. This idea was probably first considered by Bruce Wagner in the strange and visionary TV mini-series <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Palms\"><em>Wild Palms</em></a>, back in 1993. In the series, TV consumers buy a special box that sits on top of their TV set and \"scans\" their living room, noting the locations of furniture and doorways. The characters in the TV show <em>Church Windows</em> are holographically projected directly into <em>your</em> living room; they sit on your couch and ring your front door bell. You can watch them from any angle. (Part of the plot of the show is a tailor-made LSD variant that tricks your brain into thinking you're physically interacting with them. I'd love to see somebody play with that IRL.)<br /><br />But why not an AR drama, played out on the streets of the city where you live? You can watch imaginary events unfold right in front of you; an imaginary meeting between doomed lovers on the street corner across from your apartment; a zombie apocalypse unfolding at Starbucks. The most obvious narrative is something reminiscent of Neil Gaiman's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverwhere\"><em>Neverwhere</em></a>, in which the inhabitants of a fictional London Below are roundly ignored by the dull inhabitants of London Above; that would be a great narrative trick to explain why the real people you view through your AR lens aren't reacting or responding to the overlaid drama that commingles with them through the lens of your future phone.<br /><br />Of course, these are just a few possibilities off the top of my head; as the months and years progress, I'm sure we'll see amazing ideas I haven't even begun to consider come out of the AR universe. But I'm pretty convinced that the navigation tools that are our first examples of AR in the real world are lame ducks; what worries me is that their lameness will convince people to abandon the concept (much like virtual reality in the 1990s) before it really has a chance to show off.</p></p>",

                "content": "<p><a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com\">Smashing Magazine</a> (who are an awesome force for goodness in the design world) put a thing on Twitter looking for writers. I responded and they told me to send them \"an email with a brief introduction\". So I popped open Gmail and tossed this off a minute ago. Hopefully the Smashing folks will dig it, but even if they don't, this is going to be my cover letter forever.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Following your Twitter instructions, here is my email with a brief introduction. (This is the brief introduction to the email with the brief introduction to who I am.)<br /><br />Me: Joshua Ellis, responds to \"Josh\". Writer, web designer/developer. I was a columnist for eight years for the Las Vegas City Life alt.weekly; my column started as a sort of tech op-ed thing and turned into whatever I felt like writing, which apparently made the Nevada Press Association so happy that they gave me several awards for Best Column (Non-Staff) Of The Year, which is a very silly award to win, but I have plaques, so...yeah. I was also nominated for a Pulitzer for a two-part series of stories I co-wrote about homeless people living in the storm drains under Las Vegas. My publisher nominated me, but it was still an honor and I totally cried.<br /><br />Have also written for <a href=\"http://www.worldchanging.org\">Worldchanging.org</a>, The Unofficial Apple Weblog (<a href=\"http://tuaw.com/\" target=\"_blank\">tuaw.com</a>), <a href=\"http://www.coilhouse.net\">Coilhouse</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondo_2000\">Mondo 2000</a>, Mindjack, Axcess, What's On...all sorts of publications, online and etched into the dead flesh of trees. I also contributed to the <em>Underground Guide To Las Vegas</em> by Jarret Keene and wrote much of the political protest section of Worldchanging's <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Worldchanging-Users-Guide-21st-Century/dp/B002CMLQOS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1253886631&amp;sr=8-1\">User's Guide To The 21st Century</a></em>, which was in the Top 1000 on Amazon (actually, it was #13) and had an introduction by Al Gore, which means I'm welcome at the ranch in Tennessee at any time.<br /><br />As a designer/developer: I've been making websites since Netscape 1.0. I've been doing PHP/MySQL and Flash/Actionscript for about a decade. In 2003 I co-founded Mperia.com, one of the early online music stores for independent artists -- I was the creative director and vision guy, as well as the visual designer. That tanked in 2006 when our parent company, BitPass, got bought out by Digital River.<br /><br />Since then, until March of this year, I've been freelancing as both a writer and designer/developer. Currently I work as a UI engineer for MedWeb, a telemedicine company. [<em>Sentence redacted because I was being cutesy about my day job.</em>]<br /><br />I write fast, I don't misspell, and I'm pretty good at explaining complicated things to people in a way that they will remember laughing at later, even if they don't remember what I was trying to explain. And I live in Las Vegas, which is about one-fifth as cool as you think it is.<br /><br />So...yeah.<br /><br />You can obviously reach me by email at [address deleted damn you spammers]<a href=\"mailto:jzellis@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\"></a>, on Twitter at <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/jzellis\">jzellis</a>, and if you open your window, hail a pigeon, and slip a fifty under his wing, he'll deliver me anything you can write on a Post-It note. It's a trick I learned in the war.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Josh Ellis<br /><br />(P.S. You did say *paying* gig, right?)</p>",

                "content": "<p>There seem to be at least a few fans of Red State Soundsystem out there, right? So I've had an idea, and I'm hoping you'll help me with it.<br /><br />The song \"Scatterlings + Refugees\" is maybe my favorite song I've ever written, and it's going to be on the debut RSS album, <em>Ghosts In A Burning City</em>, which is dropping very, very soon. I'd like to make a video for it. I have access to decent cameras and I can edit and post-produce it myself, thanks to my clever ability to run Final Cut and AfterEffects.<br /><br />However, rather than just making some moody, forgettable video of me looking haunted in, I dunno, an old factory or some silly bullshit like that, I'd rather do something that speaks to what the song is actually about: namely, the way that people scattered across the world can form a tribe.<br /><br />So here's what I'd like you to do.<br /><ol><br /><li>Download the song, below. This is a rough mix but it's the final version, if you see what I mean; I may do some EQing on it, but this is the album version of the song.</li><br /><li>Go somewhere in the city or town you live in that you think is pretty or strange or representative of your home. Someplace that doesn't just look like another Western suburb, in other words.</li><br /><li>Film yourself singing/lip-syncing the song. Use your cellphone, your iPhone, your digital still camera with the 30 second video option, your Flip, your high-def television broadcast quality shoulder-mounted Panasonic, whatever. Use an old PixelMotion if you've got one. Resolution doesn't matter (though I'd prefer stuff that's not too heavily compressed and blocky). Ideally your video should be at least 640 x 480, but if it's really cool and low-res, I'll be down for that, too. Audio doesn't matter, as I'll be dubbing over it with the song, anyway, of course.</li><br /><li>If your resulting video is small enough to send as an email attachment, send it to me at jzellis (at) gmail (dot) com. Otherwise, contact me at that address and I'll send you to my private Dropbox account to upload it. Deadline for this is 11:59 Pacific Standard Time, Friday, July 31st.</li><br /></ol><br />When I get enough awesome clips, I'll edit them together into a full-fledged music video, which will be available on this site and Vimeo and YouTube and Facebook and MySpace and everywhere else I can put it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't offer you a free trip to Vegas or a chance to be on <em>Cribs</em> or anything like that. (Are they even still showing <em>Cribs</em>?) What I <em>can</em> offer is a signed CD to every person whose clip gets used in the video, plus a credit and a link on the video's page here on Zenarchery, and my profuse thanks and an IOU.<br /><br />I think this is a chance to actually put into practice a lot of the rhetoric going around now about crowdsourcing and making cool things for free on the Web. I hope there are enough of you who dig this song that you'll help me make something really wonderful to share with the world.<br /><br />So here goes: <a href=\"http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/audio/red_state_soundsystem-scatterlings_+_refugees_(video_mix).mp3\">here's the rough mix</a> (128kbps stereo MP3), and below are the lyrics. Let's do this thing.<br /><br />SCATTERLINGS + REFUGEES<br />lyrics and music by Joshua Ellis<br /><br />We are scatterlings and refugees, we have never known peace<br />We have never known a home<br />Home is wherever we are when we're together<br />Peace is the sound that we make when we're alone<br /><br />Well, I rang the New Year in<br />In a field out in the suburbs somewhere outside east Berlin<br />I watched the fireworks burn the night<br />And I wondered where you were and if you were alright<br /><br />We are scatterlings and refugees, we are bastards, we are orphans<br />We don't ever make a sound<br />Traversing the oceans in perpetual motion<br />Our feet don't ever touch the ground<br /><br />We went dancing<br />Old soul records playing in an alleyway<br />And we are old souls, you and me<br />Disappearing at the dawning of the day<br /><br />We are scatterlings and refugees, we have never known peace<br />We have never known a home<br />Home is wherever we are when we're together<br />Peace is the sound that we make when we're alone<br /><br />(Bridge)<br /><br />And when my telephone rings in the dark<br />You say \"Hey, I'm at the White Cross<br />On Las Vegas Boulevard\"<br />No matter where I am, I'll get on a plane<br />I'll go anywhere to see you again<br /><br />We are scatterlings and refugees<br />We are angels, we are monsters<br />We never mattered anyway<br />We're the patron saints of rented cars<br />And last goodbyes in airport bars<br />And in the morning, like ghosts<br />We slip away<br /><br />We slip away</p>",

                "content": "<p>So I was reading <a href=\"http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2009/07/interview-amanda-palmer.html\">this interview with the lovely and talented Miss Amanda Palmer</a>, and some of what she says made me think of the commentary on the music industry I wrote for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mperia\">Mperia</a>, back in the day -- specifically, my little manifesto, \"Burning Down The House\". Since Mperia is long gone and the original text isn't extant on the web, I thought I'd post it here.<br /><br />I got some of this wrong, but I got most of it right, and it's gratifying to see how much I got right so far ahead of everyone else's curve. (Hey, I may sound like a self-congratulatory asshole, but you know what? We failed. My consolation is that I was right, even if I failed. So nyah-nyah-nyah.)<br /><br />----<br /><h1>\"Burning Down The House\"</h1><br /><h2>I. What The Deal Is</h2><br />So here's the deal, folks: it's a new millenium. And if there's one thing we've learned, going into this shiny new epoch, it is this: the medium is not the message. \"Music\" does not equal \"compact disc\". Music is data. It doesn't matter whether you burn it to a CD or rip it to an iPod or a Memory Stick or store it on your hard drive. It's still music.<br /><br />Take a minute to internalize this concept.<br /><br />Once you get past the notion that music has to come in the form of a shiny little Frisbee that retails for $16.99 at your local MegaSuperMusicPavilion, certain other truths that once seemed self-evident begin to unravel -- such as the idea that the only way to become a successful musician is by signing a recording contract with a giant corporation.<br /><br />We don't think giant corporations are evil by default. But we do think that they're not very good at feeling the groove. They're not intuitive. They're not funky or majestic or numinous. No corporation in the history of civilization has ever stumbled home from a club at the crack of dawn, put the first Velvet Underground album on and kicked back to watch the sun rise. They don't -- can't -- know that feeling.<br /><br />So why are they the ones who get to make the decisions about who gets to rock and roll?<br /><br />Which brings us to Mperia.<br /><br />Mperia allows artists to sell their work directly to their audience -- the audience they already have, and the global audience behind every Net-connected browser and PDA and keitai on the planet.<br /><br />It allows that audience to find the music they already love, and the music they haven't heard yet -- the music that has yet to become part of the soundtrack of their lives.<br /><br />And maybe most importantly, for the first time in history it allows artists to earn their fortunes based upon their own merits -- not the decisions of a marketing department or an accounting department or the fickle whims of the marketplace.<br /><br />Do we guarantee you instant riches and fame? No. But we can guarantee you the one thing that the record industry has denied you for almost fifty years: a level playing field.<br /><h2>II. The Myth Of The Rock Star</h2><br />I'd like to tell you a short story. You've probably heard it (or a variation of it) a thousand times, but bear with me. See if I get any of the details wrong.<br /><br />It's the story of an idealistic kid (or kids) from out in the sticks (or the ghetto, or the trailer park, or the suburbs). The Kid's got the magic: he sings like an angel. He plays guitar like the very devil. His lyrics are deep and meaningful and poetic.<br /><br />So the Kid's playing a gig one day, right? Maybe at some roadhouse, or some smoky nightclub. And Mr. Big, the head of a major record label, just happens to be hanging out in this roadhouse or this nightclub, maybe on his way to and from one of his posh mansions or something. He hears the Kid. And he recognizes true genius.<br /><br />After the Kid's done, Mr. Big comes up to him. \"Kid, you got heart,\" he says. \"How about you come out to Los Angeles and make some records for me.\"<br /><br />So the Kid comes out, with nothing but his dreams and his guitar, and records a record. It sells a million copies. Everybody hears the Kid's music and is touched by it. He starts dating a beautiful-but-sensitive supermodel. He wins a Grammy. He makes a few more albums, and finally retires out of the public eye with Mrs. Kid (neé Supermodel) and the little Kids -- either to an old converted manorhouse in England or a ultramodern home in Laurel Canyon -- to live in bliss happily ever after.<br /><br />The end.<br /><br />Sound familiar? Of course it does. The story of the rock star, the hometown kid done good, is one of the pervasive myths of our time -- think of the Beatles in Hamburg, or Kurt Cobain in his trailer in Olympia, or Snoop Dogg on the streets of Long Beach.<br /><br />Like many myths, it contains a grain of truth. But like all myths, it's about 99% bullshit.<br /><br />The myth of the rock star is perpetuated by the recording industry to draw in fresh artists. Without these artists, the recording industry -- which, like the Minotaur in another myth, lives solely on the blood of the young and beautiful -- would dry up and wither away.<br /><br />But the reality is much less romantic. It's difficult to get accurate figures, but one recent estimate I've heard suggests that 97% of all musicians with a recording contract make less than $600 a month. That's musicians with a recording contract; we're not even counting the hundreds of thousands of musicians slogging away in the bars and the clubs every night who haven't even caught the eye of a record label -- all those Kids with all those dreams.<br /><br />You're probably shaking your head right now. Uh uh, man, I watch Cribs. These people are making it big time -- they've got the big houses, big cars, big clothes, big lifestyle.<br /><br />Actually, that's half true. Rock stars do get decked out in big cars and big houses. But they don't actually own any of it.<br /><br />Most artists, when they sign a record contract, get an advance -- or rather, to call it by its' full name, an \"advance against royalties\". In other words, the record company gives them a fat check up front .But that's not a payment. It's a loan, to be paid off by the artist via their album royalties.<br /><br />Figure that the average recording contract provides the artist with around 12% of the profit from album sales...minus the cost of promotional copies, and copies that arrive at the store broken, and occasionally percentage points awarded to the producer of the album.... When you start doing the math on a CD that sells for $15 retail, you start realizing that the artist has to sell a lot of copies to even begin paying back their advance, much less making any actual money themselves.<br /><br />And if they don't sell enough to pay back that advance? The big cars, the big houses, the bling-bling...all of it goes bye-bye. The label repossesses it. The artist is out on the street.<br /><br />So why don't you hear about this more often? The answer is quite simple. Most artists don't figure this out until it's too late -- until their sales start going down. And by that time, you're not the hot Kid anymore. Nobody's booking you to go on late night talk shows. Your fifteen minutes are up, and you're left without a media voice.<br /><br />At least, that is, until VH-1 comes knocking at your door about ten years later to do your Behind The Music special...and by then, you're just another rock casualty. And every single Kid who hears your tale of woe thinks \"Yeah, but that would never happen to me.\"<br /><br />All of this, by the way, only happens if your record label decides that your music is worth investing the time and money into. I've personally known bands who've signed with major record labels, only to discover that by the time their first album is recorded and released, they're not the flavor of the day anymore.<br /><br />These artists don't even get fifteen minutes. The label never even releases their album -- and they can't take the album to another label, or even release it themselves, because they're still contractually obligated to the label that's tossed them aside. I've even known some bands who couldn't legally perform together as a group anymore because of contractual clauses.<br /><br />But the business of music is changing. Trailblazing artists like Fugazi and Ani DiFranco have proven the point that you don't need the vast machinery of a record label behind you to be successful. You can start your own record label. You can record your own albums, do your own promotions, make your own music videos.<br /><br />Of course, all of these things require money. They used to require so much money that you needed a record label behind you to finance it all.<br /><br />But time marches on. Affordable home technology improves. Over the upcoming weeks and months, we'll be showing you how to produce your music at home, find good deals on promotion, even how to shoot your own music videos. We've found that what musicians may lack in funding they make up for with creativity and talent.<br /><h2>III. Rich And/Or Famous</h2><br />Let's take a look at some figures real quick, and maybe you'll see why we think Mperia provides artists with a remarkable opportunity.<br /><br />Let's say that you're signed to a label. You get the standard 12% royalty on album sales. We're going to simplify this and not even deal with the weird little percentage markups and subtractions that the record industry usually throws into these contracts -- we'll just say that you get a straight 12%.<br /><br />If your album retails for $15, that means you make $1.80 off each album sale. That means that if your album sells 100,000 copies, you stand to make $180,000. Sounds pretty good, right?<br /><br />But the reality is that most albums sell less than 5,000 copies over a period of months and years. If you did even that well, you'd make $9000 in that time. Plus, if you got any sort of advance from your label, you've got to pay that off before you even see a dime in actual profit. So if your label gave you a $10,000 advance, you'd probably never see another penny -- and you'd be liable to the label for any difference between the amount of advance you got and the actual amount sold. So you'd end up owing your label about $1000.<br /><br />Now, let's look at what you can do with Mperia.<br /><br />At Mperia, you can sell your work on a song-by-song basis. Let's say you've got 10 songs, priced at $1.00 each, hosted on Mperia.<br /><br />We take a 30% cut of all of your sales. 15% of that goes to BitPass transaction fees, and the other 15% goes towards our costs of doing business. We think it's pretty fair, and it's a lot less than a record label would take.<br /><br />Let's say you sell 100 copies of your big hit song in a week. That's $70. Not a whole lot of money.<br /><br />But let's say you sell 100 copies of each 10 song album in a week. Now you're looking at $700. Much better. That's enough to pay rent in most major American cities and have some beer money left over. And you're already making more money than 97% of the signed artists out there.<br /><br />If you're entrepreneurially-minded, you might decide to put that $700 a week back into your career -- buy or rent a van and go out on tour. After all, you're making enough to subsidize the costs of touring already -- and if you're getting paid to play at venues, you're making some decent cash. You print up flyers with your Mperia address on them and hand them out at shows. You might even bring a laptop and let fans buy your songs at the shows directly -- after all, they can pay at the show and download at home whenever they want.<br /><br />Boom! Suddenly you're selling 500 copies of <em>each</em> song a week. That's $3500 every week, plus your touring income. Even after touring costs, you're making more money than 99.9% of musicians with a major record label contract, and it's your money. You can use it to make videos to promote your music internationally, or to buy a big tour bus -- or to buy some expensive recording gear and use your new-found knowledge to record other artists and make even more money. Hell, spend it on brown M&amp;Ms and microbrew if you like.<br /><br />Are you suddenly famous and hanging out with Ashton Kutcher at the Viper Room? Maybe not. But you're on your way towards getting rich...and as the jazz singer Pearl Bailey once noted: \"I been rich and I been poor, and honey, rich is better.\"<br /><br />Consider this: the Grateful Dead were one of the most successful musical acts in history. Their tours drew thousands of people who did nothing but follow the band around. Their album sales were incredibly respectable -- especially considering that they only ever had one Top 40 single in the band's entire 30-year history, with the song \"Touch Of Gray\". And the bands that have followed their model -- Phish, the String Cheese Incident, even groups like the Dave Matthews Band -- regularly play to sold-out stadiums.<br /><h2>IV. What It All Means</h2><br />The record companies have been making a lot of noise about file-sharing and peer-to-peer software. While we certainly have our own opinions about the whole p2p question, we think it's a red herring.<br /><br />The record labels are afraid of the Internet because they can't control it. They can't stop you from selling your work directly to your fans. You don't need them anymore...and they know it. Peer-to-peer software isn't a cause, it's a symptom. The world is changing.<br /><br />We're here because we believe that success in music shouldn't have to do with how well you're marketed, or how pretty you are, or whether your single fits in with whatever's trendy at the moment. We believe that the Internet is the most powerful system ever devised for bringing art directly to the people who love it -- whether it be East Coast hip-hop or West Texas swing. Whatever you do, there's going to be somebody out there who wants to add your music part to the soundtrack of their lives. And we're here to make that happen.<br /><br />In the end, I guess it all comes down to one question that you need to ask yourself: do you wanna be a pop star, or do you wanna be an artist? If all you want to do is be famous, then you're in the wrong place.<br /><br />But if you're here to bring your music to the people and make some money doing what you love, then Mperia is the place for you. And I'd like to thank you, on behalf of the entire Mperia crew, for letting us help you to help yourself.<br /><br />Now. Let's kick some ass, shall we?</p>",

I asked the band if I could do this quite a while ago, but life intruded; getting a copy of Ableton made it much easier.<br /><br />I really like my remix; it's almost a throwback to late-90s era Moby and UNKLE, though there's a lot more going on in there than you might assume at first listen.<br /><br />I don't know if the band will make the remix available anywhere for download, but if they do, I'll be sure to let you know here!</p>",

                "content": "<p>So I finally acquired a legal, full copy of Ableton Live, as payment for designing a logo for a client. Yay!<br /><br />As anybody who reads this blog knows, I'm a big fan of algorithmic/rule-based/non-interactive composition. As much as I love writing songs, I also love simply setting up the computer to generate music on its own, leaving me to tweak the timbre and tones of the piece rather than the notes.<br /><br />This is astonishingly easy in Ableton Live. The basic rundown is like so:<br /><ol><br /><li>Create a MIDI track. Add an empty MIDI clip to it.</li><br /><li>Inside the MIDI clip, create a series of 16th notes. Doesn't matter what they are -- just add C3 notes.</li><br /><li>On the MIDI track, add the Random and Scale MIDI plugins.</li><br /><li>Set the Random plugin to Chance -&gt; 100%, Choices -&gt; 24. This will cause Ableton to randomize every note, within a 2 octave range.</li><br /><li>Set the Scale plugin to whatever scale you'd like -- I'm using Em in this example. This forces the randomized notes into an Em scale.</li><br /><li>Route your MIDI track's output to a synth or to an app like Reason using ReWire.</li><br /><li>Hit play.</li><br /></ol><br />What you'll get is an endless bunch of notes in Em. How this actually turns out depends upon your ability to create interesting synth tones, your use of effects, etc. Obviously you'll want to do this on multiple tracks with different instruments.<br /><br />\"<a href=\"http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/audio/red_state_soundsystem-cool_black_marble.mp3\">Cool Black Marble</a>\" (MP3, 192kbps, 3:19) is a track I did last night and this morning using this technique. It reminds me sonically of <em>Avalon</em>-era Roxy Music, or maybe just the background textures. While this piece isn't ever going to win awards for variation or compositional complexity, it's a perfectly lovely little bit of ambient music in the most literal sense -- it's an ambient soundtrack to a space. (When I hear it, I think of, well, a cool black marble room, hence the name.) Think of it as simple, pretty sonic wallpaper.<br /><br />Of course, you can do much more complicated stuff than this using these basic tools -- you can automate the Key value in the Scale plugin, for example, to create chordal changes and more complex melodies. You can also automate Live's clip triggering function to randomly choose beats or melodic instruments or pads. I'm going to be experimenting with this kind of thing a lot, and I'll post my results.<br /><br />Let me know what you think of the track in the comments!</p>",

                "content": "<p>A couple of years ago, I delivered an incoherent, profanity-laden and probably awful lecture on the <a href=\"http://jwz.livejournal.com/543348.html\">Grim Meathook Future</a> at the <a href=\"http://www.ccc.de/congress/\">Chaos Communications Congress</a> in Berlin. (In my defense, I was completely unhinged due to jet lag and the meltdown of my MacBook the night before the talk, when I'd planned to finish my speech and the accompanying slides.) I barely remember delivering the lecture at all, but I do remember absolutely pissing off a good number of the collected attendees with my assertion that things like blogs and social networks aren't very useful technology to people who are starving to death or being slaughtered by warlords.<br /><br />One of the audience members, journalist <a href=\"http://quinnnorton.com/\">Quinn Norton</a>, stood up and pointed out that bloggers in Russia were exposing to the world the corruption and chaos underlying that nation's political system. Which, of course, was true; I wouldn't deny it. But as I remember, she didn't have a satisfactory answer to the question I returned to her, and the question that I find myself asking tonight, as great numbers of good-hearted and well-meaning people are filling the Twitterverse with commentary and urgent info about the riots in Tehran following the suspect re-election of Mahmoud Ahmedinajed.<br /><br />Yeah? So what?<br /><br />As you can read in my previous post, I was called to task by a few people for my perceived cynicism in being unwilling to tune myself into the stream of info on the repression in Tehran. It's not the first time. Though I am a technofetishist of the highest water and a futurist by both trade and inclination, I am deeply suspicious and cynical about the effects of technology on human culture. This does not endear me to a lot of my friends and colleagues in the Internet industry, but if I spent much of my time worrying about what would endear me to people, I'd either put a gun in my mouth or turn myself over to Jesus.<br /><br />I think that one of the greatest fallacies of our time -- and one of the greatest leaps in logic that is made again and again by people who involve themselves in the worthwhile struggle to bring equality to all people -- is the notion that <strong>awareness equals involvement</strong>. By providing a way for the world to see the terrible things occurring in Iran right now, we believe that we are somehow \"doing something\" about the problem -- that we are, in some way, affecting change.<br /><br />I don't argue that this is sometimes the case. Many times, in specific sorts of circumstances, the rallying cry of \"the world is watching!\" is enough to defuse a dangerous situation. But many other times, it's not, and the only person who is empowered or even enervated by global awareness of tyranny and oppression is the person watching events unfold...not the person in the middle of them.<br /><br />Twenty years ago, the world watched on television and in the pages of magazines and newspapers as a young man, anonymous to this very day, stood in front of a tank in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China, as part of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989\">a protest</a> that served as a memorial for recently deceased official Hu Yaobang. His act served as a sort of visual icon for the resistence of the common man against the repression of totalitarianism, and is rightly regarded as deeply heroic. It also served to draw international attention to China's brutal policies of self-censorship and intellectual repression.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nobody knows what happened to that young man. Given what has been seen in other cases of protest in China, it's likely that the poor guy is either long dead or serving out a prison sentence somewhere. And in the twenty years since that day, China has made only sporadic and small progress in the human rights arena, despite the efforts of millions of people in government, non-governmental organizations, human rights watchdog organizations, and the simple negative public opinion of probably billions of people around the world, who felt righteous indignation on behalf of that anonymous hero, unable to legitimately protest his government's actions in his own land.<br /><br />China still operates under totalitarian repression of outside media as well as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Shield_Project\">Golden Shield</a> (aka the \"Great Firewall Of China\"), which blocks access to any outside data deemed threatening to the ruling Communist party in the country. Despite this, there is still a flow of information in and out of the country, and human rights violations -- as well as violent censorship of free speech, free thought and dissent -- are still apparently quite common in China.<br /><br />In other words, global public opinion has not affected China much over the past two decades. In fact, China is growing as an economic superpower whilst retaining their oppressive practices, due largely to the West using the country as a manufacturing base. We don't make our shoes and computers in spite of their totalitarianism: in point of fact, we <em>rely</em> upon it. In a democratic society where protest is legitimized, it would seem likely that Chinese workers would protest the sparse wages paid to them by American and European companies to manufacture our goods and gadgets. They might even unionize. But that will never happen so long as our dollars and pounds and Euros shore up their totalitarian regime.<br /><br />And yet, this notion continues to this day: the idea that the act of being aware of a situation is the same thing as involving oneself in it.<br /><br />The logic seems to go like this: by making people aware of this terrible situation (protesters being attacked, imprisoned or killed in Iran, for example), we are bringing the discourse into the court of public opinion. We will make our leaders and our people aware of what is happening elsewhere, and then...something will happen to change it.<br /><br />To be fair, this <em>does</em> work...but only in places where public opinion has a marked effect upon the actions of the regime (whether it be urban, federal, or what-have-you). If, for example, police in an American city attack an innocent African-American simply on an assumption of guilt based upon race, public opinion can certainly create consequence for the wrongdoers. The public can threaten to oust the mayor of the city (or at the very least not vote for him/her in the next election), the mayor can put pressure on the chief of police, etc. etc. In such ways are change affected in a democratic society, and public opinion can be a massive engine of change.<br /><br />But this all breaks down in the case of totalitarian societies, because by and large, there's really not much that you, as a non-member of that society, can do to affect change.<br /><br />Let's look specifically at the case of Iran right now. People are up in arms because it <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/06/15/iran.elections.qa/\">seems likely that the ruling party rigged the elections</a>. (Americans, of which I am one, don't <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Florida,_2000\">really have a lot of room to talk</a> here, but let's overlook that for a second.) A certain amount of people in Iran are protesting the results of the election. They are, by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/Change_for_Iran\">all accounts</a>, getting pretty <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-iran-protester15-2009jun15,0,7099947.story\">brutally censured and attacked</a> for doing so, while the government denies that anything of consequence is happening.<br /><br />First of all, let's just be honest here: knowing that people are being attacked for protesting is probably most of what you need to know. The specifics are, in my experience, <a href=\"http://www.quotedb.com/quotes/3041\">pretty self-similar</a> in any situation of this type throughout history. I haven't read the accounts of what's going on in Iran, but I suspect it runs something like this: the election results are announced. People -- probably mostly students at first -- take to the street in anger. The storm troopers show up and start bashing skulls. People begin rioting. The riot squads get more brutal. The government begins locking everything down -- the media, first and foremost. People are dying in the streets. Shit is on fire.<br /><br />How am I doing?<br /><br />I'm being cynical here, but being cynical doesn't mean it's not true. These people are in a terrible situation. They're making an agonizing choice between being quiet and being free. My heart and my sympathies and my support go out to them.<br /><br />But the sad fact is that they're probably simply going to their deaths. Why? Because they have no weight behind their dissent. Their government is a totalitarian theocracy run by a pack of lunatics who are actively developing nuclear weapons on the grounds that they might have to scorch the earth for Allah. They've been brutally repressing their people for decades now; how is this any different? Meet the old boss, same as the old boss.<br /><br />More importantly, for the purposes of this discussion: if the people of Iran have no weight behind their outrage, people outside of Iran have less than no weight. Why? Because public opinion is totally irrelevant to Ahmedinajed's regime. He -- and his master, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei\">Ayatollah Khamenei</a> -- don't care what you or your government think about them. They have Allah on their side, total righteousness. They're also the fourth largest oil exporter on the planet. Oil counts for 80% of their export capital, followed by -- I'm not making this up -- <a href=\"http://www.indexmundi.com/iran/exports_commodities.html\">fruits and nuts, and also carpets</a>.<br /><br />Putting a worldwide ban on oil imports from Iran would be an instant way to affect change there. The money would run out...and even in theocracies, money is what keeps things running. If the rest of the world were to ditch Iranian oil for twelve months, I guarantee you'd see massive political change there.<br /><br />But that, of course, isn't going to happen -- not on a global scale, not even on a national scale, and not on a personal scale. The majority of the people Twittering about Iran today are going to get in their car and drive to work via oil that was, at least in part, sold to them indirectly by the same people they're trying to undermine with information technology. Hell, I would suspect that the power which keeps Twitter's servers running is probably, at least in part, coming from Iranian oil in one way or another.<br /><br />What we're getting out of Iran right now is, essentially, evidence of the crimes being committed. I doubt anyone would disagree with that. But gathering evidence is something you do when you think there's going to be a reckoning, and the sad example that history shows us is that there rarely ever is. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet\">Augusto Pinochet</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol_pot\">Pol Pot</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idi_amin\">Idi Amin</a> all died of heart attacks at advanced ages, either under house arrest or in lush exile somewhere. Their subordinates, by and large, also escaped justice, usually by insisting, as all fascists do, that they were \"<a href=\"http://www.politicalaffairs.net/article/view/4459/1/223/\">simply following orders</a>\".<br /><br />All the Twittering in the world isn't going to create a world court that has jurisdiction over Mahmoud Ahmedinajed or the Ayatollah Khamenei, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Kony\">Joseph Kony</a> in Uganda, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_jong-il\">Kim Jong-Il</a> in North Korea, or any of the other insane cruel sons-of-bitches who rule with an iron fist over vast swaths of humanity. Pictures of the dead and dying, biographies of the damned...gather what you like and it's still not going to fix these problems.<br /><br />There <em>are</em> solutions, real solutions, but they take real work and sacrifice, on the part of every person who wants to truly change things. Stop driving cars; spend more money on products not made by totalitarian regimes; do without. And we are not willing to make those real sacrifices.<br /><br />So we bear witness, as if the act of <em>merely</em> bearing witness somehow absolved us of our complicity in these atrocities. We tell ourselves that feeling righteously indignant is somehow a useful act, when the only person who is truly affected by our righteous indignation is ourselves.<br /><br />We feel like heroes, when in fact we are as irrelevant to the situation as the thirty-eight New Yorkers who, in 1964, watched their neighbor <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitty_genovese\">Kitty Genovese</a> get raped and robbed and stabbed to death in the courtyard of their apartment building. Each of the witnesses has been variously quoted as saying that they didn't want to \"get involved\". They were rightly vilified for this attitude.<br /><br />Now, we want to get involved. So we use our global networks as stadium seating for the atrocity exhibition, and we cluck our tongues and shout our derision at those who commit torture and murder. And we feel better about ourselves. But we don't make the hard choice to step into that ring ourselves, to make even the most basic sacrifices or put ourselves on the line, to prevent the atrocity. We're concerned, but not involved.<br /><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And today, as I write this, God only knows how many Tehranians are going to be beaten and killed by the bastards who rule their country. We're going to stand around and Twitter our anger to one another. And those poor people will be just as dead as Kitty Genovese when all is said and done.</p><br /><p style=\"text-align: center;\">*     *     *</p><br /><br /><em>If I've made you angry here, might I suggest that you call or write to your Congressperson or MP or whatever your nation's equivalent is?

                "content": "<p>John Perry Barlow <a href=\"http://twitter.com/johnperrybarlow/status/2174304145\">called me a smug dick on Twitter tonight</a> because <a href=\"http://twitter.com/jzellis/status/2174157128\">I pointed out</a> that <a href=\"http://twitter.com/jzellis/status/2174194549\">the collective outraged Twittering</a> about Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's rigging of the elections in Iran <a href=\"http://twitter.com/jzellis/status/2174246467\">probably wasn't going to change a goddamn thing</a>. He's half-right. I am a dick, but I'm not feeling particularly smug about it. (I also think JPB misunderstood me, though the error is mine; Twitter is not the place for nuanced thought.)<br /><br />Look: Iran is a (very) thinly-veiled theocracy. It's run by a group of clerics led by Ayatollah Khamenei, who is just as far out to lunch as his predecessors. Ahmadinejad is just their front man, a polite face to turn to the international community. But underneath it's the same bad craziness that's been there at least since they overthrew the Shah.<br /><br />Theocracies of any stripe are totalitarian, almost by definition: their control relies upon their forcing of faith upon their people. That's why they control the media and access to information: if people can see alternative viewpoints, they might begin to question the validity of the theocracy's underlying faith, and by doing so, undermine the theocracy's power. This is all obvious, right?<br /><br />Until Iran overthrows the Revolutionary Guard (and what an ironic name) and the clerics and establishes a secular government, they will never have any sort of real freedom.<br /><br />The real problem with totalitarian regimes, whether it be in Iraq or North Korea, is that they are essentially immune to public opinion. They don't give a fuck what you or I think about their policies, because a) they can't be toppled by bad public opinion, and b) they control the ability of their people to engage in political discourse with you or I in the first place.<br /><br />So: yes, I am absolutely outraged that people are dying in the streets of Tehran right now. I am furious. But I <em>can't do anything about it. </em>My opinion won't save those people. My righteous fury serves no purpose at all. And neither does yours.<br /><br />The riots and the deaths in Iran today are a symptom of a larger problem. The Iranian people have to get rid of their government. Until they do, this will just keep happening again and again, and more people will die who don't deserve to, and the rest of the world will keep tut-tutting away, and <em>nothing will change</em>. Unless America decides we want Iran's oil, in which case we'll go in and bomb them back to the fucking Stone Age and make martyrs of all those God-deluded fuckers who are turning that place into a nightmare. Which will, of course, simply turn it into another kind of nightmare.<br /><br />Anybody who knows me knows that I have watched this happen for a long time, in Iraq, in Uganda and Liberia and the Sudan and Rwanda and all of these other places. I have spoken out, asked people to get involved, done as much as I could from where I sit. (Hell, I've even offered various groups my services as a tech geek in these places, though no one has taken me up on the offer yet.) I believe as strongly as anyone in the right of every human to be in charge of their own destiny, and to be free of fear and violence for their beliefs. Don't ever bring up the subject of Uganda with me, or the Lord's Resistance Army; I'll start frothing at the mouth and ranting. I'm a Human Rights Bore, and I know it. Sorry.<br /><br />But I'm just <em>tired</em>. Tired of watching passionate students take to the streets to defend their human rights and to proclaim truths which much of the world holds to be self-evident, only to be mowed down by dispassionate thugs hired by a government that will commit murder to hold on to power. Tired of seeing the horror. Tired of watching politicians in my country pretending to be concerned, because they have no economic basis for helping to change things. Tired of watching celebrities (far more smug than I could ever be, John, thanks) doing PSAs trying to get bovine fucking America to be concerned about a bunch of jabbering foreigners half a world away.<br /><br />The idea of throwing my brain into this current Iranian horror just makes me want to curl up in a ball and vomit. I can't watch the videos. I can't read the news. Because I will just become enraged, with no outlet for it and no way to change things, and I will have to watch yet another group of poor bastards get crushed by history.<br /><br />Does that sound cynical? Surely it does. Surely I <em>am</em> cynical. But man, I've seen this movie too many fucking times, and I know how it's going to end. And whether I watch it or not, it's going to play out in the same way. I wish I was wrong, I hope I'm wrong, I pray that somehow this will all be resolved with as little more bloodshed as possible, but I just don't see it happening that way. I know people. I know history.<br /><br />I know I'm a coward. Man, don't you know that I know that? I am. And I am truly sorry if I sound like a smug dick. But I just can't get in on this one, folks. I need to be able to sleep at night.</p>",

                "content": "<p>I was watching <a href=\"http://blog.gretchenpeters.org/\">author Gretchen Peters</a> tonight on <a href=\"http://www.hulu.com/watch/76565/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-mon-jun-8-2009\">yesterday's <em>Daily Show</em></a>, promoting her new book <a href=\"http://blog.gretchenpeters.org/?page_id=2\"><em>Seeds Of Terror</em></a>, about the links between the poppy trade in Afghanistan and Pakistan and the Taliban and al-Qaeda. It looks like a fascinating book, and I'd like to pick it up and read it before I offer any comment specifically on her take on things. But I've been thinking about this a good deal over the past few years, and I thought I'd throw my two cents in.<br /><br />I suspect that, when historians look back upon the early 21st century \"war on terror\", their primary response will be surprise: surprise that the global society allowed ourselves to be fooled for so long into believing that terrorism is really, at the base of it, about such lofty ideals as \"religion\" and \"freedom\"...when, in fact, it was actually about what everything in the world is about and has been since the end of the hunter/gatherer period in human evolution: namely, money and resources.<br /><br />I've been thinking about what I know about Islam (which is, I'll grant you, not a massive amount...although having lived in a Muslim country and read at least a little bit about the history and tenets of the faith, I'm way ahead of most Americans), and what I know about economics (about the same amount) and what I know about people (quite a bit, actually), and it seems obvious to me -- and has for a long time -- that the people running things on the \"terror\" side of the equation are probably not actually religious zealots, but rabid market capitalists.<br /><br />Bear with me here.<br /><br />First off: let's just drop this \"terrorist\" shit. That's an extremely non-useful term that obscures more than it describes. I say \"terrorist\" and you think of a <a href=\"http://itstrulyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/terrorists.jpg\">douchebag in black fatigues with a checkered head scarf and an AK slung over his back</a>. But that doesn't actually tell you who these people are, what they do, or why they do it.<br /><br />Let's start with what they do, and that's simple: they <em>destabilize</em>. Regions, governmental system, economies -- destabilization is the one thing that people like al-Qaeda are good at. They're utterly, completely useless at <em>stabilizing</em> anything at all...which necessarily gives lie to their claim that what they're trying to do is establish some sort of theocratic control over the Middle East / Africa / Asia / wherever. They're not establishing <em>shit</em>. They're not even <em>trying</em>. They're like drunk frat boys -- the only thing they can do is fuck shit up and then walk away. (The Taliban in pre-9/11 Afghanistan being an exception, but not much of one -- those little elves ran their Keebler tree at the barrel of a gun, funding it with narco trafficking, and doing so mainly at the pleasure of the good old U.S. of A, who ludicrously saw them as a viable alternative to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Democratic_Party_of_Afghanistan\">PDPA</a> and/or Soviet involvement. Which is an entire other discussion. Don't get me started.) Destabilization has in fact traditionally been the number one goal of most terrorist groups around the world -- Muslim or otherwise. Which brings us to our next question: why?<br /><br />The answer, I think, is simple: misdirection.<br /><br />Imagine you have a country -- let's call it, for the sake of this discussion, Ellistan. Ellistan is a country which is relatively rich in oil, but doesn't have the technological prowess to really go in and extract it and sell it. So Ellistan's doing deals with big American firms like Exxon Mobil, who take a large chunk of the oil profits in return for up-fronting the massive costs of building an oil-delivery infrastructure.<br /><br />There's also a lot of poppy fields, as there are everywhere in the Middle East. Fucking <em>tons</em> of them. There are a few <em>narcotraficantes</em> who grow poppies and ship them out to Southeast Asia to be refined and sold to <a href=\"http://www.latfh.com/\">scruffy American trust-fund assholes</a>. But by and large, it's a cottage industry, because opium is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin#Manufacturing\">fairly difficult to refine and turn into smack</a>, and unlike oil, the Agency for International Development isn't brokering meetings between the Ellistan government and Big American Business to build roads for trucks full of black tar heroin.<br /><br />Speaking of governments...Ellistan has a democratic government, sort of. There's lots of corruption and tension. To make matters worse, there's a nasty brewing conflict between the Muslim and Christian factions of the population, who are also divided along some <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_of_Tutsi_and_Hutu\">fantastically obscure ethnic lines</a> going back to which of two thirteen year old sisters got knocked up by the horny old king a gazillion years ago. There are occasional outbreaks of violence, but it's nothing that doesn't happen every day in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_countries\">most of the countries in the world where you can't buy a Slurpee on every street corner</a>.<br /><br />And then comes Jihadi Pride. Jihadi Pride is a radical Islamist group founded by a prick who used to be a <em>mujahideen</em> in Afghanistan back in the 80s. He was trained in insurgent warfare, intelligence and counter-intelligence by his kindly Uncle Sam, who also bankrolled his holy war against the evil Soviet Empire...right up to the moment when the Wall came down in Berlin, at which point America informed him that they would see him, but they wouldn't wanna be him.<br /><br />Since then. the prick has been building up this army of former holy warriors like himself, along with a random assortment of creepy mercenaries who pass the bare minimum of behavior to pass for \"soldiers of God\", plus a huge infantry of complete retards whom he has convinced to become martyrs for Allah.<br /><br />(He's also on a dialysis machine. And he's <em>really fucking tall</em>. You get it? You get it now? Okay.)<br /><br />So this prick -- let's call him Rosama -- sets up tents in Ellistan. He immediately begins pimping his contacts amongst the Muslim community. He starts going around identifying the most dissatisfied or volatile community leaders. He tells them that a glorious day is coming, a day when the People of God -- who rightfully deserve Ellistan as their Holy Paradise -- will rise up against the infidels and drive them out, even if it means wading in their blood. He makes some under-the-table contributions to local religious leaders, who may or may not be the same people. And he tells both groups that, when the time comes, he will do everything in his power to back their play to take power.<br /><br />Now, if Rosama is <em>really</em> smart, he's doing <em>the exact same thing with the Christians</em>. He's playing both sides down the middle, without the other side knowing it.<br /><br />And sooner or later, somebody's going to mouth off at the wrong time in the wrong tea house, or kill the wrong person in a brawl, and shit is going to jump off: Christians and Muslims in a free-for-all.<br /><br />When this happens, Rosama <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larne_gun-running\">shows up with crates full of AK-47s</a>. Here you are! he cries to the Muslims (and, again, if he's smart, the Christians). Use these to drive the evildoers out of your land!<br /><br />Blood starts spraying all over everything. The government sends in troops to try to quell the ethnic violence, but their efforts are (as such efforts <em>always</em> are) as useful as tits on a bull. Soon the troops get involved on both sides of the conflict and now you've got trained dudes firing.<br /><br />Jihadi Pride is sending all its best kamikaze assholes, strapped with C4, to suicide bomb Christian pre-schools, on the promise that they'll get 37 virgins and a free Amana refrigerator upon entrance to paradise. These guys are fucking morons and totally useless for anything else, but they're also sort of like Doritos: crunch all you want and you can make more. To <a href=\"http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/h/hlmencke137243.html\">paraphrase Mencken</a>, nobody ever went broke overestimating the intelligence of the religion-crazed masses.<br /><br />Finally, one -- or both -- factions accuse the government of siding with and favoring the other side, and there's a big to-do, and maybe somebody runs in and sprays the Ellistan Parliament with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ak-47\">7.62mm</a> rounds. And boom! No working government. There's general strikes, everybody's either fighting or afraid to come out because they're afraid of being killed. Things fall apart. The center does not hold. Jihadi Pride has loosed mere anarchy on Ellistan.<br /><br />And what is Rosama doing while all this is happening? He's sneaking around killing the low-level <em>narcotraficantes</em>, or buying them off, or convincing them to work for him. He's seizing control of the poppy manufacturing. Think of it like a big corporation with massive distribution channels but a need for product, seizing a small corporation with product but no distribution. Rosama, unlike the local boys, can ship poppies <em>en masse</em>. More to the point, he now is in a great position to set up poppy refining centers right there in Ellistan...because nobody's paying <em>any fucking attention anymore</em>.<br /><br />Then Jihadi Pride seizes the oil pipelines...and all hell breaks loose. Up to this point, it's just been a bunch of camel-fuckers killing each other, as far as the rest of the world is concerned. But holy God and sonny Jesus, now these ragheads are fucking with our <em>profit margins</em>!<br /><br />Exxon Mobil formally protests to the US government, who talks to the UN, who sends in \"peacekeeping\" troops, who basically do jack shit other than make sure all the Yankee engineers and contractors and their families can get out safely. Which they do -- not because Jihadi Pride is afraid of the UN, but because it <em>doesn't really matter to them</em>.<br /><br />Exxon's frothing over their pipelines, but hell, they've got insurance against this sort of thing. Jihadi Pride is also doing them a favor, kind of, sort of, because now that they've seized this particular oil supply, the global price of oil can go up a bit. And it's not like it's going to go back to the same price when all of this is settled.<br /><br />So now Rosama is de Kingfish in Ellistan. He's got control of the oil and the poppies, and he's surrounded himself with enough chaos that nobody can come in and touch him. Maybe, possibly, by this point, the local ethnic factions are beginning to realize that they've been played off each other. But it's too late. There's nobody to appeal to. Nobody has any sympathy. And at this point, the hatred and vengeance has all gotten so deep that nobody's going to shake hands and make friends and go against their common enemy, this mercenary pigfucker who's come in and turned their Holy Paradise into a shit and smoke filled nightmare.<br /><br />That is, assuming they even get that far in their thinking, and most of the time they don't. They just keeping slaughtering each other, murder for murder, atrocity for atrocity, because somebody ten thousand years ago decided to wear a different hat than his brother wore, or something equally pathetic.<br /><br />And Rosama? He's got a few options. He can leave some of his crew here to run things and float on to the next target. (My, Iran's looking interesting!) Or he can just keeping letting the money roll in here. Even when order is established, all he has to do is cut the new government in on the deal. Not that they have a choice, of course -- any new government in Ellistan will form almost solely at his whim.<br /><br />And Lord, how the money rolls in. By the time America gets involved -- because <em>only</em> America will get involved, because the Europeans are too smart and too poor and don't have enough vested financial interest -- Rosama will be nowhere to be found, and all that will be left will be a nation in utter shambles and a bunch of abandoned gold-plated Humvees, rusting in the sand and the dirt.<br /><br />This is, of course, just a fairy tale I'm spinning you, but I'd be grateful if you could figure out what part of it doesn't sound like it's probably pretty accurate across the board. The real kicker is that, as Bruce Sterling pointed out in his excellent book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Tomorrow-Now-Envisioning-Fifty-Years/dp/0679463224\"><em>Tomorrow Now: Envisioning The Next Fifty Years</em></a>, they <em>did this already</em>: in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkan\">Serbia</a>, in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basayev\">Chechnya</a>, in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Farrah_Aidid\">Mogadishu</a>. In Kabul. In Iraq. Over and over again, after Reagan and Bush Uno let them loose on the planet like rabid dogs off a leash. It's not even the same <em>sort</em> of people; it's the <em>same five dudes going from place to place</em>. (There's more than five. But you get my point.)<br /><br />And they're not the only ones. Because I can think of at least one other evil motherfucker who went in and destablized an entire region, turning it into a morass of ethnic/religious violence, whilst simultaneously making money off of guns and war machinery on both sides, whilst simultaneously lining the pockets of everybody he'd ever known since grade school...and right now, <em>that</em> sonofabitch is sitting with his feet up on his ottoman at the new place in North Dallas, watching <em>Hee-Haw</em> reruns on Blu-Ray and sporting a weak little boner every time Barbi Benton pops up in the cornfield to trade cornpone witticisms with Buck and Ray. And I'd bet the ottoman's still got that <a href=\"http://dallasfurniturewarehouse.net/\">new leather smell</a>, too.<br /><br />Hey, why not? His daddy and his daddy's friends were the ones who taught the trick to the \"evildoers\" in the first fucking place. And if we learned anything from the IRA and the Contras and Al-Qaeda, it's that you can pretty much get away with anything you like, if you claim you're doing it in the name of God or country. Patriotism has become the very <em>first</em> refuge of scoundrels; the second is the nearest church or mosque.<br /><br />And all of this begs the question: are we <em>really</em> trying to shut down the drug trade in Afghanistan and Pakistan now? The way we tried to stop the drug trade in Laos and Cambodia during the Vietnam War? The way we tried to stop it in Central America in the 80s? Because as far as I can tell, the way we tried to do that in those places was to come in and bum rush the whole show, <em>New Jack City</em>-style. I mean, does anybody <em>really</em> believe the CIA wasn't using heroin from the Golden Triangle to fund black ops in the 1960s and 1970s (and maybe even as far back as the 1950s)? Really?<br /><br />I'm not much of a fan or believer in conspiracies, and even I'm convinced that behind all the mad rhetoric, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huey_P._Newton\">Huey Newton</a> was right about one thing: they were shipping scag back from Laos and Cambodia into the Naval receiving shipyards in Oakland. I've also talked to too many old timers who've told me I'm right, at least in the broad strokes, to assume that they were all separately utterly full of shit.<br /><br />And it's not like they didn't try to do it again, 20 years later with the Contras...only that time, they got caught.<br /><br />So you have motive (money), opportunity (the war on terror), and a pattern and <em>known history</em> of similar behavior going back almost fifty years. Is it hard to believe that we're not stopping the drug trade because we have some vested interest in it? I'm not talking about the whole government, mind you; but I think there are people in the intelligence community who are capable of maintaining covert drug trade in Afghanistan. Our forces on the ground are having enough trouble keeping themselves alive and some vague semblance of daily peace and calm to be paying much attention to some weird shit going on out in the eastern mountain regions. To <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_61_Revisited_(song)\">quote Bob Dylan</a>: yes, I think it could be easily done.<br /><br />Even if you leave the US government out of it -- and even the most neo-conservative of you will acknowledge that it's nearly impossible to leave the US government out of <em>any</em> international situation these days -- doesn't this whole thing suggest that the primary, if not the solitary motivation of these \"terrorists\" is not religion but profit?<br /><br />To put it another way, which seems more likely to you: that a bunch of genuinely angry religious fanatics would stoop to selling and making smack (which would be considered <a href=\"http://www.opioids.com/opium/halal.html\">a horrible transgression by any legitimate Muslim</a>) to fund their campaigns...or that a bunch of scumbag mercs and drug dealers would wrap themselves in a cloak of pious zealotry as a way to distract the world from what they're <em>actually</em> up to, the way that <a href=\"http://www.patrobertson.com/\">any cheap con-man</a> in America knows he can put out a donation box in the name of blue-eyed Jesus and <a href=\"http://charityreports.bbb.org/public/Report.aspx?CharityID=1390#fundRaising\">rake in a hundred times as much profit</a>.<br /><br />My experience of human nature suggests the latter. The notion of Muslim holy men selling smack to decadent Westerners as a way of corrupting them seems unlikely to me. It's like suggesting that <a href=\"http://www.focusonthefamily.com/\">Focus On The Family</a> invests heavily in bondage gear, in the hopes that all the leather queens in San Francisco will kill themselves off of auto-erotic asphyxiation and rid the world of homosexuality. It sounds like bullshit to me.<br /><br />Of course, any policy wonk you talk to will probably acknowledge most of what I've pointed out here. It's not a secret. So why are we still cloaking all of this as a thinly-veiled holy war, rather than an operation to rid the world of scumbag heroin profiteers?<br /><br />I wish I didn't know the answer to that question.</p>",

This is what's most important about it:<br /><br />GPS (which determines the device's location) + digital compass (which determines the device's current direction it's being pointed in) + tilt sensors (which determine what angle the device is pointed at) + video camera = augmented reality.<br /><br />The screen shows what the video camera is \"seeing\". You point it at a building. The sensors \"know\" you're at longitude X latitude Y, facing 35 degrees from true north, phone pointed directly ahead. It queries Google Maps, finds out what building/object is closest to longitude X / latitude Y, at a 35 degree angle.<br /><br />It puts that information on the screen, overlaid on top of whatever you're pointing your camera at. What's this building? It's the Chelsea Hotel. Click here for the Wikipedia entry, or the Yelp entry. Here's a photostream of Sid Vicious being escorted out of this building in 1978 after allegedly murdering his girlfriend. Oh, he walked right by where you're standing.<br /><br />That person walking in front of you? They have Supermagical Bluetooth Person App open. That's Susie. She's also a big Arcade Fire fan.<br /><br />Do you see where I'm going with this? Always on augmented reality.<br /><br />There's also the fact that, if you can store position, direction and angle in DCIM, every picture taken in any given space with an iPhone 3GS can be used to recreate that space in 3D. If you can pull the focal point and direction out as well, you might even be able to <em>actually recreate 3D objects from a collection of 2D images</em>. Like they did in the <em>Matrix</em> sequels, only without the massive budget. No processing. Just calling up pics and arranging them via their own metadata.<br /><br />I now have a nerd boner.</p>",

Or rather, specifically, she's arguing against calling it the \"Matthew Shepherd Act\". Why? Because, according to Rep. Foxx, Matthew wasn't actually killed because he was gay.<br /><blockquote>The hate crimes bill that’s called the Matthew Shepard Bill is named after a very unfortunate incident that happened where a young man was killed, but we know that the young man was killed in the commitment of a robbery. It wasn’t because he was gay. The bill was named for him... but it’s really a hoax.</blockquote><br />Are we really still at this place in our society? I mean, hey, by all means, let's <em>grudgingly</em> pass a law making it illegal to stomp a faggot to death, but let's not call it after Matthew Shepherd, because before those two pieces of shit pistolwhipped his skull to a pulp and left him hanging off a goddamned fence to die, they snagged his fucking wallet...which is <em>clearly</em> proof that it wasn't a hate crime. Right?<br /><br />Rep. Foxx later claimed she made a \"poor choice of words\", but I don't really think that covers it. Poor choice of thoughts, maybe.</p>",

Sir,\" he adds, nervously.<br /><br />Tullius -- a squat man with a scarred, cropped scalp and squinting eyes -- stares at Seneca for a moment, expressionless.<br /><br />\"Your name is Seneca,\" he says, not a question. Seneca nods. \"Yes, sir.\"<br /><br />\"Your father is Seneca the lawyer?\"<br /><br />Seneca blinks, unsure where this is going. \"Y-yes, sir.\"<br /><br />\"I expect your father has taught you to think critically, Seneca. To ask questions. To understand things.\"<br /><br />\"He has, sir.\"<br /><br />\"That's because <em>YOUR FATHER WASN'T EVER IN THE FUCKING ARMY, YOU FAT, STUPID CUNT,</em>\" Tullius shouts, his face suddenly a hair's breadth away from Seneca's, who recoils as if a snake has spit at him.<br /><br />\"Your father was too busy prancing around, playing grab-ass with the rest of the homos in the forum, while men like me were picking our fucking guts up out of the mud in Greece and Carthage fighting that sonofawhore Scipio,\" hisses Tullius. \"In fact, your <em>daddy</em> is too much of a fucking sissy to even put his fat fucking <em>son</em> in the <em>actual</em> legions; he thinks you're going to have a <em>niiice</em>, cushy position as an <em>immune</em> for a few years, until he can get you an apartment in the City and you can find yourself a nice Greek ladyboy to turn your asshole inside out twice of a fucking evening.\"<br /><br />\"I--\"<br /><br />\"Shut the fuck up, Seneca. Do not speak. Do not fucking ever speak in my presence again, or I'll pull that tub of guts open and use them as a hammock the next time I fuck your mother.\"<br /><br />Tullius steps away from Seneca, who coughs and looks as though he's about to vomit. On either side of him, Pontius and Longinus try to stifle laughter. They have a private wager going: the actual date when Seneca finally learns to keep his goddamned mouth shut.<br /><br />\"The reason you're not allowed to reconnoiter the enemy,\" says Tullius loudly to all of them, \"is because <em>you</em> are fucking <em>idiots</em>. There is zero chance that you would accomplish anything save getting yourself caught, captured and tortured for information. The idea of that bothers me not even in the fucking slightest -- I know you have no information of any kind in your skulls, and your prolonged and horrible deaths would probably even be a relief to the ugly bitches who spawned you.<br /><br />\"But I would be extremely unhappy were you to give our presence and position away to Arminius,\" Tullius continues. \"I would have to go to the Pi-- to the <em>General</em>,\" he says, catching himself in time, \"and explain to him why a pack of retarded surveyors managed to fuck up the simple task given to them and put his army into the shit even an instant before <em>he</em> decides to put it there. Were that to happen, I would dig a hole down to Hell, find your souls, and set them on fire with my fury.<br /><br />\"Do you understand what I am saying to you, maggots?\"<br /><br />\"Yes, sir,\" they say in unison.<br /><br />\"Good. That's very good. Now, I think we're all familiar with the particulars of your assignment to me. No one expects you to be good at your job.\" Tullius shakes his head. \"Personally, I doubt you'll survive a single week out in those goddamned woods.<br /><br />\"But maybe you will. If you do, come back and tell me what you've found.\"<br /><br />He regards them for a moment, gravely.<br /><br />\"Now get the fuck out of my sight.\"</p>",

Nor would I. The company I work for is relatively small, and their sole purpose in this is to provide medical services.<br /><br />Am I conflicted by all of this? Of course I am. I've never made a secret of my opposition to the Iraqi War; quite the opposite, in fact. I spent the better part of the last decade denouncing the war in print and online. My position hasn't changed; I think the war was a horrible mistake in almost every possible way: ethical, moral, logistical, and in terms of what it has actually accomplished. I think that it was architected by bad people for cynical reasons, and I think that any good which has come out of it was incidental to the actual purposes of the war.<br /><br />However, my opposition somehow didn't actually stop the war from happening. It has happened, is happening right now; and I find myself in a position to make things better, maybe, in a very tiny way. Maybe I can be part of a system which helps save a few lives.<br /><br />That doesn't mean that money isn't a major motivation here. Sorry, but it's true. In an economy that's spiralling downward, the chance to make decent money would be hard to pass up under any circumstances. Making decent money doing something I find exciting and challenging and useful for the world is something I couldn't pass up.<br /><br />I get the feeling, even on short acquaintance, that the people I'm working with are sincere in their desire to use their skills to build technology that will benefit the people who have been victims of this war. If I didn't, I wouldn't be here. Money is good, but I still have to sleep at night, you know?<br /><br />I've thought long and hard about this, and I think I'm making the right decision. Time will tell.</p>",

I'm going to stop drinking sodas (which I mostly have, even diet, unless I'm in a place where it's soda or whiskey). I'm going to pretend that chocolate is made out of hydrochloric acid and will actually burn me if it enters my body. If I need something sweet, that's what bananas are for.<br /><br />I know you're about to tell me that bananas have sugar in them. You're probably also going to tell me that some scientific article you read says that bananas give you rickets or the King's Evil or something.<br /><br />Fuck off. Eating an entire bunch of bananas, complete with the tarantulas that illegally immigrated amongst their leaves, is better for me than a single Chocodile, which is my sick and sad weakness when stopping in for smokes at 7-11 of an evening. So quit your weird gastrological nonsense, which you probably got out of an old copy of <em>Maxim</em> or <em>Stuff</em> you were leafing through while waiting in the doctor's office for the results of your herp test. So you were freaked out and YOU DON'T EVEN REMEMBER WHAT THE ARTICLE REALLY SAID, BECAUSE YOU WERE TOO WORRIED ABOUT HAVING TO REGISTER ON HERPES DATING SITES TO GET YOUR SEXY TIME ON.<br /><br />Also, no more mocha lattes, which is a punishment described to Dante Aligheri by Virgil as being meted out to New Media Fuckheads in the Fourth Circle of Hell.<br /><br />(And yes, they had New Media Fuckheads in the Dark Ages. What do you think Johannes Gutenberg was? He sat around in the coffeehouse in Mainz all day, tapping away on his printing press in his designer horn-rims and hoping chicks would ask him what the hell it was and what he was doing with it. Which was writing a novel about a guy who invents a printing press and then moves to Bali to discover the glories of untrammeled nature, while getting coke-fueled blowjobs from Merovingian raver girls in leather jackets.<br /><br />Alas, like the dreams of all New Media Fuckheads, this didn't work out for J-Gut, so he put on a suit and got rich printing Bibles instead. But I bet you he thought about that novel 'till the day he died.)<br /><br />Back to work now.</p>",

                "content": "<p>I went to <a href=\"http://www.thegunstorelasvegas.com/\">The Gun Store</a> today with Andi and her friends from California so that I could price and check out some guns.<br /><br />Let me be clear on this: I don't actually like guns. I'm a constitutionalist, so I believe the Second Amendment is just as important to protect and enforce as the First...but I personally don't like the idea of owning a gun.<br /><br />However, it might be necessary in Iraq. Who knows? It might not. But I figured I'd go down and see what my options were, anyway.<br /><br />Gun stores are also problematic for me. I love them because I'm a gadget geek, and they're always full of awesome gadgets: holsters, batons, body armor, cool little tools for doing obscure things with guns, tasers, and knives. Lots of knives.<br /><br />But a lot of the people who tend to hang out in gun stores are people with whom I don't have a lot in common. Different cultures, different politics. I fall pretty solidly on the \"liberal\" side of things, and in my experience, this is not true of gun store rats.<br /><br />The store was absolutely packed today, which was fairly surprising, with people of widely varying age, sex, race, and taste in clothes. They were mostly clustered around the pistol counter, looking at various automatics. I browsed a bit, inspecting the pink body armor (for girls!) and tasers until a spot came up.<br /><br />The gentleman behind the counter reminded me of my great-grandfather, if my great-grandfather had been dressed in black and carrying a pistol on his belt. I told him my situation, told him I didn't know much about guns but that I'd heard that Colt 1911s were excellent. He agreed and showed me one.<br /><br />\"I've lived in the desert a long time,\" he said, \"and this is not the gun I'd take to Iraq.\"<br /><br />\"Really?\" I said. He nodded.<br /><br />\"The 1911 is an excellent gun, but it's not made for the kind of environment you'll be in over there. It's got a lot of fine parts. I'll sell you one if it's what you really want, but I don't recommend it. Let me show you the one I'd recommend,\" he said, putting the 1911 back in its case.<br /><br />He walked down to the end of the automatic counter, where it joined the revolver counter in an L-shape, and produced a small, blocky, two-toned pistol.<br /><br />\"This is a Glock 12,\" he told me. \"It's much better for harsh environments than the 1911. The 1911 has 124 moving parts, but this only has 34. No external safety, you see. And it uses 9-millimeter ammo rather then .45 caliber. That's what everybody in the world uses, so you'd have much less trouble getting ammo over there.\"<br /><br />He put it in my hand. It felt solid. It always surprises me that the weight of a gun <em>doesn't</em> surprise me or feel weird. It weighed exactly what I expected it to weigh -- maybe a pound, pound and a half.<br /><br />\"Is it hard to clean?\" I asked. He shook his head. \"Easiest gun in the world to clean.\" He did something with buttons on the gun and the slide popped off. I he showed me the spring and the clip and the receiver and how they were cleaned and how to put them back together again afterwards.<br /><br />I don't know if I want to buy a gun, or if I can actually carry one over there, though I've been told I can. If I do buy one, it'll stay in a safety deposit box until I walk out the door to get on the plane.<br /><br />But it's useful to know what the best tool for the job would be.</p>",

                "content": "<p>Taking a break from coding and house cleaning -- I have a birthday party here tomorrow night, and my house is a wreck.<br /><br />I've decided, tentatively, to blog about my current unique situation. People seem interested in how this came about and what I'm doing to get ready to go to Iraq. (I'm pretty sure it's going to be Iraq; it might also be Afghanistan, I'm told.)<br /><br />There are a few things I feel a bit...sketchy about putting out in public, for various reasons. I'd prefer not to name the company I'm working for at this juncture. It's not a secret or anything, by any means; but I'm becoming increasingly aware of the nature of public discourse. I have no idea who's reading this, who could be Googling various terms. And my thoughts and opinions do not represent anyone but myself, so why not just leave it at that?<br /><br />There are other things I don't think I can tell you, because I'm going to be getting a \"secret\" level security clearance, and I don't want to jeopardize that, so I'm erring on the side of caution.<br /><br />With that in mind.....<br /><br />So far my new job is great, if oddly schizophrenic. My duties are, as I've mentioned, two-fold: to develop an interface for a web-based software package, and to deploy, support and provide training for that software to military hospitals in Iraq. The former involves sitting around in my home office in my big terry-cloth boxing shorts, listening to David Bowie and building CSS guidelines and doing graphic design. The latter involves hauling my ass around a war zone in a Black Hawk with a spare server in my bag.<br /><br />These are not similar tasks.<br /><br />On Tuesday morning -- the morning of my 31st birthday, as it happened -- I joined in on a conference call to orient those of us who will be going \"downstream\", as the people in the company refer to overseas deployment. (I find this really interesting; I'm assuming the \"stream\" part of \"downstream\" refers here to the data stream. This is a different metaphor than a lot of expat workers I've known use. They refer to it as being \"in country\", the way Vietnam vets used to. Then again, a lot of the expat workers I've known were engineers with my grandfather, and several of them actually <em>were</em> Vietnam vets, so maybe that's where the terminology came from.)<br /><br />The orientation scared the shit out of me on several levels. The sheer amount of paperwork involved in getting a security clearance is astonishing. There's several rounds of vaccines as well, including anthrax.<br /><br />And then there's the whole \"getting shot at\" part. When I first heard about this job a few weeks ago, I assumed that \"going to Iraq\"  would be like when my grandfather would go to Saudi Arabia or Kuwait when I was a kid -- I'd be put up in a hotel somewhere in the utterly safe Green Zone, where I would occasionally venture out into the wilderness to bring fire to the mortals.<br /><br />Not exactly. No hotel for me, and the Green Zone apparently isn't as safe as I thought. I was warned about what to do when -- not <em>if</em> -- mortar fire came in. The gentleman leading the orientation, who serves as a sort of security officer for my company if I understood correctly, told us to expect to be shot at when traveling by air. We won't be traveling by ground at all, apparently, because it's incredibly dangerous. (Visions of the opening reel of <em>Iron Man</em> crossed my mind.)<br /><br />\"You're just gonna have to get used to it,\" he said. \"I can't tell you how many times I've been riding along in a Black Hawk when I heard shots popping off. The machine gunner next to you's gonna be firing. There are bad guys and they want to kill you.\"<br /><br />Odd, for someone who has been so utterly ambiguous about the whole conflict over there, to think of \"good guys\" and \"bad guys\". But I think the security officer gave me all the answer I need: the bad guys want to kill you. Anything beyond that, while I'm over there, will have to wait.<br /><br />I spent the rest of the day with a sort of sinking feeling in my stomach. It's one thing to talk about going into a war zone as a journalist; it's another to realize that, if all goes according to plan, you're actually going to <em>do</em> it, not as an observer but as a sort of sideline participant, in six months.<br /><br />I am not ready for this.<br /><br />But I might be, in six months. I am going to do everything in my power to get myself ready. I'm going on a relatively strict diet and exercise regimen. Exercise is a bit tricky for me, because of my torn rotator cuff and trick knees, but I'm going to do my best. I'm going to try and quit or seriously curtail my smoking before I leave. I want to be in at least reasonable shape when I arrive in Baghdad, if not full-on Gerry-Butler-in-<em>300</em> shape.<br /><br />I'm also going to be taking a course or two on gun safety and marksmanship. I think I need to know how to load and fire a pistol. (I already know how to fire an AK-47, but I'm going to work on that as well.) I'm also pondering taking a course on urban escape and evasion.<br /><br />If that sounds paranoid, well...so be it. The other guys I'm going with are doing the same thing. Because this isn't a fucking game, and even if we're non-combatants we're going to be in a war zone, and we're going to be targets. I'd rather know how to get my Jason Bourne on and never, ever need to use those skills than find myself on my knees in front of a video camera while some asshole hacks my head off with a rusty bayonet.<br /><br />(And yes, I've thought about that. What I'd do if I got kidnapped. The answer? Do my best to kill every motherfucker I see, because these dudes aren't really about ransom demands. They take Americans and they kill them and they put it on YouTube so the world can see. If I get grabbed, I think I'm going to assume that I'm dead, and I'm going to do whatever I can to get out...because if I don't, I end up on SomethingAwful.com as the Grisly-Ass Video Of The Day.)<br /><br />Finally, I'm learning Arabic. A friend loaned me the Rosetta Stone language course for MSA (Modern Standard Arabic) and I've also got <em>Arabic For Dummies</em>. I was told it wouldn't be absolutely necessary -- I won't be directly interacting with a lot of native speakers, and there will be translators available for when I do -- but again, it can't hurt.<br /><br />A couple of people have tried to dissuade me from doing this, because of the danger. But I can't back out, for a number of reasons. The money is astonishing for someone like me with no real career track record and no college degree. (I'm not going to tell you what I'll be making on top of my salary as a per diem when I'm downstream, but it's...impressive.)<br /><br />It's also a chance to quit sitting in the cheap seats and go out there and do something to help the world. The software I'm working on might -- in fact, probably will -- save lives. Not just the lives of American soldiers, which would be worthwhile enough, but also civilians and even enemy combatants. I will actually be doing something that makes the world a better place. And that, to me, is worth the danger.<br /><br />And there's the other reason, the one you might not understand: I can't turn this down, can't walk away, because I've said I've wanted to do it for at least a decade, and because I've talked enough shit from where I sit comfortably in the middle of the wealthiest country in the world. To back off would be a pussy move. I have to have the courage of my own convictions, and I have to be able to back up all the shit I've talked for so long.<br /><br />So that's that, then. As long as I can pass the security checks -- which my co-workers assure me won't be a problem, though I'm not so sure myself -- we're doing this thing.<br /><br />So that's where we are right now. And I need to pull the laundry out of the dryer, and get back to my CSS.</p>",

This was accomplished via an app called <a href=\"http://screenfashion.org/releases/the_wiinstrument/\">The Wiinstrument</a>, which translates Wii data into MIDI signals -- specifically, in this case, a sharp value difference in the Wii remote's and Wii nunchuk's built-in accelerometers...using them as drumsticks for playing air drums, in other words. The MIDI was sent into a software drum machine, which had a heavily reverbed drum kit loaded.<br /><br />I'd been thinking about doing this for months, but I'd never actually tried it until last night. I set it up at home yesterday afternoon and attempted to have my girlfriend play the Wii drums while I played guitar. Unfortunately, she...well, let's just say she couldn't quite get the rhythm down. So this was, in fact, totally untested until I actually got Joe the audience member up on stage.<br /><br />It was really fun and everybody seemed to find it fun. I picked \"Just Like Honey\" because it's an easy, easy drumbeat to play. \"Heroin\" I picked because I knew Aaron could improvise on it (he's an excellent drummer as well as guitarist), and because my guitar was already feeding back with the sound I'd picked for \"Just Like Honey\"...and because I can play the living <em>shit</em> out of \"Heroin\", and I hadn't played it live in a while.<br /><br />So there you go. I plan to use the Wii as an instrument a lot more in the future -- it's fun and easy and it looks cool.</p>",

I rocked out and debuted a new feature, in which I picked a random member of the audience to play drums with a Wiimote on a cover of the Jesus &amp; Mary Chain's \"Just Like Honey\". It actually worked perfectly! And then -- as the audience wanted an encore -- my occasional bandmate and buddy Aaron Archer came up and used the Wii to back me up on a cover of the Velvets' \"Heroin\". Which was so tasty -- the drums were all reverby for \"JLH\" and I ran my acoustic guitar through my Vox ToneLab, so it was all noisy and feedbacked and it sounded beautiful. Everyone also enjoyed my cover of \"Northern Sky\" by Nick Drake; the rest and majority of the set were originals, including some new stuff I haven't played or recorded yet.<br /><br />In fact, you'll be able to hear it, I think: I recorded the show on video. If the sound's not too awful, I'll put the songs up on YouTube.<br /><br />Thanks so much to those of you who attended. Maybe next show we'll get a bigger crowd.</p>",

Imagine what would happen to this city if even a quarter of the tourists simply stopped coming one day. Las Vegas has precisely one major industry, and most of the people who work in it ain't exactly switching over to exciting careers in nanotechnology if they lose their gigs as blackjack dealers and graveyard-shift cocktail waitresses and maids and convention-booth babes and porno-flyer dispensers. No offense, but it's the truth.<br /><br />The jobs go away, and so do the people, in droves. The fragile real estate economy here goes down like a Bangkok whore on roofies. Your shiny stucco McMansion -- and whatever equity you've put into it -- is suddenly worth less than the shoddy material it was built with. You're jobless, probably homeless, and you can't even afford to drive your big shiny SUV back across the empty desert to a place where you can grow your own food and sleep outside. Maybe you can live in it -- park it out in the arroyos somewhere with the rest of the neo-Okies from Arizona and California and all the other places that rely entirely upon the fossil fuel economy in one way or another for survival. Learn to love the taste of cactus and flame-broiled Gila monster.<br /><br />Proper fucked. You see what I mean.</blockquote><br />Exhibit B: An <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/2009/02/12/cities-ten-top-lifestyle-real-estate_0212_cities.html\">article by Forbes Magazine</a> on the abandonment of America cities:<br /><blockquote>For decades, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/2009/02/12/cities-ten-top-lifestyle-real-estate_0212_cities_slide_17.html?thisSpeed=30000\" target=\"_blank\">Las Vegas</a>, ripe with new construction and economic development, burgeoned into a shimmering urban carnival. <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/2009/02/12/cities-ten-top-lifestyle-real-estate_0212_cities_slide_16.html?thisSpeed=30000\" target=\"_blank\">Detroit</a>, once the fulcrum of American industry, sagged and rusted under its own weight.<br /><br />These days, it's the worst of times for both.<br /><br />Las Vegas edged Detroit for the title of America's most abandoned city.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Will Las Vegas eventually suffer the same fate?<br /><br />\"I don't think Vegas is overbuilt,\" says Hallier. \"Despite what everybody says, Vegas still has 2 million people.\"<br /><br />Time will tell if this sort of optimism is warranted. Cynics who've witnessed Detroit's decline might liken Hallier's opinions to another Dickens oeuvre: Great Expectations.</blockquote><br />Yeah. So you know what, Las Vegas? Next time I tell y'all something, fucking pay attention.<br /><br />Now quit whining, sell your shitty starter home, and move into a trailer on Boulder Highway. And don't say you weren't warned.</p>",

Chris immediately said \"That's a plane engine going out.\"<br /><br />We looked up...and there, between us and the Strip, was a Southwest Airlines plane...and the right (starboard, yeah?) engine was on FIRE. A tight, long (maybe 30-40 foot) stream of pure yellow flame ripping out the back. No smoke.<br /><br />I think we both said \"Holy fuck!\" at the precise same moment. We jogged down to the end of the block to follow it. It was headed east-northeast, and it wasn't gaining altitude -- it was only 1000-2000 feet up at that point -- and we thought it was about to drop out of the sky. We thought the pilot might try to make it to Nellis Air Force Base, north...but we didn't think he was gonna make it that far. But we didn't hear a boom and we didn't see smoke.<br /><br />Other neighbors and passers-by came over. One of my neighbors had a police scanner and he heard it was a Southwest flight and that the pilot was gonna try to circle around the city counterclockwise and come back to McCarran Airport. But we couldn't see the plane.<br /><br />And that was all, really, until I saw on Twitter -- via local newsman Dave Courvoisier -- that the plane landed safely.<br /><br />But I have never in my life seen anything like that. I mean, I <em>know</em> that a plane can fly with one operational engine, but it was so loud and so...well, so totally on fire...that I thought it was gonna come down in suburban Vegas.<br /><br />I'm glad all the passengers on Flight 273 got out safely, if Twitter is telling me correctly.</p>",

            "name": "An Open Letter To President Obama",
            "source": {
                "content": "<p>Dear President Obama,<br /><br />(I'm still quite tickled to be able to type that, by the way.) Congratulations on your election, and on your inauguration, which drew, by some accounts, one of the largest crowds of humans ever assembled in one place in human history. If you had thrown up a bunch of speakers, whipped out a set of Technics turntables and started spinning drum 'n' bass, you could have totally re-enacted the rave scene from the second <em>Matrix</em> movie, except, y'know, actually cool.<br /><br />But I digress.<br /><br />I'm writing you because I have some concerns. \"Already?!?\" I hear you saying. \"Good God, Ellis, I've been President for less than a week! What do you want from me, guy?\" I know. I'm sorry. You're new at the office and you haven't got your bearings yet and I can totally dig that. As an avid reader of my website, Zenarchery -- which I'm sure you are, as a sophisticated man of taste -- you'll know that I am one of the shareholders who totally supported your ascendancy. So I hope you'll take this as what it is -- a concern, not a criticism.<br /><br />Namely, my concern is this: last week, as you were barely setting up your desk gadgets and programming the White House's office sound system with your favorite jams and presumably installing your GTD productivity apps on your new desktop Mac (well played, there, sir), you <a href=\"http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2009/01/obama-sides-wit.html\">held up your predecessor's request</a> to set aside a ruling by a federal judge that a document obtained by illegal wiretapping in a terrorism case should not be admissable as evidence. I'm sure you're familiar with the case, but if not, hit that link and check it out.<br /><br />Now, you are a lawyer and far be it from me to try and school you on legal matters, but even I know that wiretapping American citizens without a warrant is grossly illegal. Beyond the violation of the letter of the law, it also contravenes the spirit of the American Constitution, which is as close to an operational manual as our country has ever gotten. Doing it -- even for the best of reasons, even to <em>save lives</em> -- is a gross violation of everything that America means.<br /><br />As a lawyer -- as a former Senator, and as President of the United States -- you know this, of course. I'm not trying to educate you, which would fall decidedly under the category of teaching one's grandmother to steal sheep. What I hope to do is persuade you that you cannot let this one slip.<br /><br />The last eight years have been a nightmare for Americans. Your predecessor, George W. Bush, was the worst president this country has ever had. He was, in fact, an utter imbecile, and in a just world he would have spent his life being displayed for money in street fairs, rather than taking the reins as leader of the most powerful nation on Earth. I have seen lab rats that were more competent at finding cheese in a maze whilst under the effects of psychotropic drugs than George W. Bush was at being president.<br /><br />You know it, I know it, Joe Biden knows it, Joe the Plumber knows it, Simon Cowell's personal assistant knows it, the guy who sells tractor tires out of the back of his F-150 in the parking lot of the Flying J Truckstop outside of Preacher's Corners, Nebraska knows it. Small children playing football with a half-deflated soccerball in the narrow byways of the <em>favelas</em> of Rio know it. People in the village where your father came from, in Kenya, know it. Emperor penguins, floating on rapidly shrinking bits of ice in the rapidly warming waters of the Antarctic, know who is responsible for their fate and curse his name and his vicious redneck ways in their clacking language. The entire world knows that George W. Bush is, for lack of a better description, teh suck.<br /><br />This is not merely because he was a stupid, venal, incompetent man. It's not just because his idea of diplomacy looked like a bunch of beer-drunk rednecks trying to pick a fight outside a strip club in the suburbs of Houston. Nor is it simply because his handling of American economic policy showed the same level of financial responsibility, long-term planning and understanding of the larger market issues that you might have gotten from, say, a half-dead wolverine that had been nailed to the corpse of Kenneth Lay and propped up at a shareholder's meeting, <em>Weekend At Bernie's</em>-style.<br /><br />These are all, certainly, mitigating factors. But the worst -- the very worst -- thing about George W. Bush was that he seemed to regard the Constitution and the Bill of Rights as only being useful when the White House staff forgot to supply the West Wing with toilet paper.<br /><br />But in our darkest hour -- when it seemed like that semi-literate jugheaded cracker was <em>never</em> going to quit lighting firecrackers under the feet of Lady Liberty -- you came along, President Obama.<br /><br />I don't know if I can make you understand the real despair that I've felt, looking at America for the past eight years. It is not theoretical despair, it is not an intellectual exercise. I have wept, at times, at the indignities and atrocities perpetrated by the Bush administration in the name of the American people, of which I am one. I have been ashamed and I have been angry and I have been held powerless to do anything other than shout into the wind...which I have done, long and loud, though I doubt I'll ever know if it did any good at all.<br /><br />You, Mr. President, are a beacon of hope for people like me: people who believe in America but despise what has been done in her name; who believe that, for all their flaws, our founding fathers, the framers of the Constitution, genuinely wanted to build a country whose entire <em>raison d'etre</em> was the idea that humans could throw off the heavy weight of history and teach themselves to be free. You are a beacon because I believe, like so many of my friends and family and fellow countrymen, that you believe this too.<br /><br />And because of this, I beg of you: <em>do not let this decision stand</em>. Do not begin your presidency by following in your predecessor's footsteps. You have in so many other ways and so very quickly already begun the work of undoing his bad and shameful acts. Undo this one.<br /><br />If you look through the preamble to the Constitution -- surely one of the most remarkable ideas ever put to paper by our species -- you will find a good deal of talk about liberty and freedom and the rights of the people. You will find nothing at all about trading those rights and freedoms and liberty for any measure of security. Nowhere does it say that Americans should or will forgo their right to due process because they are afraid of being attacked by outside forces.<br /><br />In times like these it is hard to know what is right, when we are afraid for ourselves and our families and our people. This is not our first crisis, and it will not be our last. In such times, when looking for guidance, we have that Constitution to serve us. It is part of the oath you took last week to defend the Constitution, by which is meant that you ought to defend the rights and responsibilities that the Constitution places upon every man, woman and child in this nation. All other considerations -- economic, security -- are secondary.<br /><br />Is this case a small thing, in the grand scheme of things? Perhaps. But it is no less worthy of your full consideration because of that. Small decisions have large consequences: the decisions you make now, in your first days as leader of this nation, provide precedence not only for your own term of office, but for generations to come.<br /><br />And so I ask you, Mr. President, to re-consider your decision on this matter, to weigh the full facts, and to make your decision with the same great commitment to the Constitution and transparency in government that you have already shown in such a short time. It is the right and honorable thing to do; and right now, our nation needs her ragged honor more than anything else. To paraphrase a great writer: be one of the good guys, Mr. President, because there's way too many of the bad.<br /><br />I believe in you, and trust that you will do the right thing.<br /><br />I hope this letter finds you well, and bearing up under the heavy pressures of your new job. Like all Americans, I sometimes believe I could do your job better than any of the men who have done it before; like most Americans, I have neither the strength of will nor the capability to ever find out.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Joshua Ellis<br /><br />(A copy of this has been posted to my website, http://zenarchery.wpengine.com.)</p>",

And today we have renewed that resource.<br /><br />And we will remember, I hope we will remember, that our hope is not predicated upon the successes or failures of one man or one party or one government. America is not her president or her government. America is not her territories or her economy.<br /><br />America is a belief, held at first by only a few people, that we can pull ourselves out of the muck of history -- of predetermination and of the inevitability of tyranny and failure. The people who believed that were flawed people, but their idea was good. And over the past two centuries, their idea has become shared by the whole world. It has not only become popular, but essential to the survival of any nation -- the understanding that the power to do good or ill rests ultimately in the hands of the citizens.<br /><br />I believe that Barack Obama will be a good president. I hope that he will be a great president. But my hope is not entirely in his hands. My hope comes from the simple fact that he was elected...because it tells me that America's people recognize our mistakes and missteps and want to find a better way.<br /><br />I am confident, for the first time in a long time, that we will find that way. It is good to have a good president, but it is better to have a citizenry who are willing to accept the responsibility for running their own country. And Obama's election, I believe, is a sign that we are ready to do that.<br /><br />And me? I'm off to the coffee shop to work on my novel.<br /><br />Because some things <em>never</em> change.</p>",

I have a couple of friends who are police and, by large, they and their colleagues do as best they can in a thankless, difficult and probably traumatizing job. I think 95% or more of policework happens within boundaries which are tolerable by society.<br /><br />But then you have the stupid bastard in Oakland who murdered a kid on New Year's in the BART station -- a kid who, by all accounts, was the victim of an attack by a bunch of other guys. The dude is on the ground, he's cuffed behind his back, he's got his face on the pavement, there are two policemen on him -- one on his neck, one on his back. He looks like he's struggling a bit, but nothing particularly out of the ordinary.<br /><br />Until the cop that's on his back stands up, draws his gun, and <a href=\"http://www.ktvu.com/video/18409133/index.html\">shoots the suspect point-blank. With two different people filming him from different angles</a>.<br /><br />I can't think of any way this is even remotely justifiable. I mean, <em>I</em> could have kept that guy on the ground with nothing more than a firm hand. His hands were cuffed behind his back. He was face-down. He had another cop holding him. How in the <em>hell</em> did anything about this situation require the use of deadly force? Particularly in the middle of a bunch of <em>other</em> cops? The officer holding the kid's neck couldn't have been more than twenty inches from where that bullet hit.<br /><br />What kind of complete fucking retard psychopath shoots a cuffed, unarmed, mostly docile suspect <em>with another cop holding him right next to your gun</em>?<br /><br />I hope they fry this fucker. Because there's no worse misuse of power than to murder someone who not only can't fight back, but who legally can be killed if he <em>does</em> try to fight back.</p>",

I don't much care for his religious preferences, but they are no more my business than mine are his. Of course I feel very sorry for the man and his people. Losing a teenage child must be unimaginably painful. My sympathies extend, as they would to anyone I vaguely knew about whose child died.<br /><br />And unlike the apparent majority of my countrymen, I'm willing to leave it at that. Because none of it is my business in any way.<br /><br />Celebrity, in this country, has become a monstrous thing and our central currency. We have no more musicians or singers, we have rock stars and divas; we have no actors, we have action heroes; and many of the people who are famous now are famous for no reason at all. The fact that <em>I know who <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian\">Kim Kardashian</a> is</em> -- despite my best attempts to keep myself out of such things -- is terrible. I still don't know <em>why</em> I know who she is, though I've seen her have sex on camera with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_J\">that awful singer</a> that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hI4bSCy9iE\">Burial sampled</a>. But she's a bad amateur porn actress at best. (And she <em>is</em> bad. Trust me.)<br /><br />And poor John Travolta, who's probably out of his mind with grief right now, has to deal with the most contemptible excesses of celebrity media. I feel even worse for the guy because of it.<br /><br />Please, America, go back to living your own hopeless, soulless lives, and quit sticking your nose into the soulless, hopeless lives of people you see on TV.</p>",

I haven't gotten my contributor's copy yet, but the little bits of proofing I've seen make it look awesome. So if you like the piece, order the magazine and check it out. (You should order it anyway. <em>Coilhouse</em> is amazing. Zo and Meredith and Nadya are doing an incredible job over there.) I've got another piece in this issue as well, a conversation with my old friend R.U. Sirius about cyberpunk and futurism and how he helped me get girls when I was a teenager.<br /><br />So go to it.<br /><br />[Full disclosure: I didn't receive any payment for <em>Coilhouse</em> using the piece. As far as I'm concerned, y'all paid me for the piece a long time ago; I just wanted to see it in print somewhere, and I'm glad it's in <em>Coilhouse</em>, which is shaping up to fill the void <em>Mondo 2000</em> left a decade ago. It's an awesome mag.)</p>",

(And almost certainly not that of Jesus of Nazareth. Remember the whole bit about \"shepherds in their fields\". In December, in the Northern Hemisphere? Not likely, not even in Palestine.) It was the first day of the year when the lengthening of the daylight hours was noticeable to ancients, and it symbolized the triumph of day over night.<br /><br />Which is what Christmas ought to always be about, whether you're a Christian or not: the recognition that light still shines in the darkness. This has been a terrible year for me personally and for a lot of people in the world in general. But <em>light still shines</em>.

(I love David Byrne.)<br /><blockquote>We tend to get all holier-than-thou when we look at countries without free press. We think their lives must somehow be more pathetic or sad. Needless to say, this attitude makes us feel better. But people go on. They know, or at least suspect, that they are being denied something, but they maintain hope and optimism. They don’t go around moping. They get on with their lives, and sometimes, at least now and then, feel like maybe the censorship doesn’t matter all that much. There are still reasons to be cheerful. We might like to think of life in an oppressive regime as sheer misery, but from what I can tell, it’s rarely viewed that way. Life goes on and people make do with what they have, and they fall in love and get drunk and sing and dance. It takes a lot — a whole lot — to bring them to the flash point, like what just happened in Greece. Mostly, people adapt to the way things are — and to feel miserable about it is fruitless. And that’s what we will do when there are only two serious newspapers left in the USA.</blockquote><br />via <a href=\"http://journal.davidbyrne.com/2008/12/121808-no-more-news.html\">David Byrne Journal: 12.18.08: No More News</a>.</p>",

Decided not to walk all the way to Starbucks, got a Diet Dr. Pepper from the 7-11 instead and came back home.<br /><br />Man, oh man. Barbara and I weren't incredibly close, but I considered her my friend and I think she considered me the same. I always liked her very much. She was adorable and, conversely, possessed of a wonderfully foul mouth and a wicked sense of humor. She was someone I was always happy to see and hang out with, when I ran into her.<br /><br />We emailed and spoke a couple of times while she was in New York acting. I hadn't seen her, I don't think, since she came back to Vegas, but I'd been hoping I'd run into her somewhere. I got an email invite from her the other day to some professional network like LinkedIn, but I hadn't responded to it.<br /><br />I can't imagine Barbara dead. I can't imagine Barbara killing herself. (I seem to have an unplaced memory of seeing her crying once, though I can't remember where or why, but she never struck me as a particularly depressive person.) Worst of all, the last time she'd come up in conversation was when Alex told me, a few weeks ago, that she'd just gotten married in October.<br /><br />Man, oh, man. That's the second one of my friends to commit suicide this year. As somebody whose thoughts turn that way sometimes, I'm always surprised when someone actually does it -- other people seem so much stronger than I am. But I guess I'm still here, which I guess means I've got something keeping me going. I just wish I knew what that was, so I could share it with people like Barb.<br /><br />I'll miss you, girl. I'm so sorry.</p>",

Please do check it out, as I think it's a good piece. And if you don't know Sam Cooke, check it out immediately. You'll thank me.<br /><blockquote>If you’ve ever heard Sam Cooke’s voice, in songs like “Cupid”, “Twistin’ The Night Away” and “Bring It On Home To Me”, you’ll know it for the rest of your life; there is literally no other voice like it on Earth, never has been, and probably never will be. His voice was clear, strong, earthier, simpler and less operatic than that of other R&amp;B singers like Marvin Gaye or Smokey Robinson…but when Sam Cooke sang a song it stayed sung. Even though his songs were, by modern standards, pretty simplistic, he understood what the Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca called <em>duende</em>, the melancholy at the heart of all real beauty, and all the best Sam Cooke songs have a grace note of sadness in the middle of what is otherwise joyous rhythm and blues. “So Mister / Mister DJ / Keep those records playin’ / ‘Cause I’m-a havin’ such a good time / Dancin’ with my baby” he sings in “Having A Party”, and it’s the way he sings the word “deejay” that kills you, a minor key change that contains all the ambiguity and hope that must have gone with being a teenage or college kid in the early years of the 1960s.</blockquote></p>",

It's a frank examination of her life and her legacy.<br /><blockquote>Whereas Borges was a writer and Monroe was an actress, Page was a body—as pure an object as the pornographer can manage.  Page was never really asked to act (unless cat fights and bondage performance count as ‘acting’ at a level comparable to Monroe’s embodiment of a character).  Page was merely asked to ‘be’.  But to ‘be’ only as an object, subject to our gaze, subject to the whip, subject to an open handed spanking.  Indeed, the binary qualities of bondage and domination are found in the subject-object relationship.  Her ‘80s and ‘90s resurrection as a figure of interest was as an image to be drawn, dressed up, or otherwise consumed, which serves to further exemplify the prominence of Page the image as object to be manipulated or to be used as decoration.  Her “life” was erased by the image that she had become.</blockquote><br /><a href=\"http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/66907-bettie-page-dead-since-1957/\">Bettie Page, Dead Since 1957 &lt; Pop Past | PopMatters</a>.</p>",

            "source": {
                "content": "<p>So I know I've been terribly remiss in posting on Zenarchery these past few months. It has not been a good year for me. Long and short of it is just mostly money issues, some of which seem to be mostly settled, some of which are only beginning. But there's also my wisdom teeth, which I simply can't take care of right now. The abscess under my tongue went away with medication, thank God...but one of the teeth is apparently growing through the joint of my jaw and, in fact, slowly breaking it. I've begun to be able to feel it, like my jawbone is being pulled apart like a wishbone, slowly and inexorably. Sucks, but I just don't have the money or the time to do much about it right now.<br /><br />And frankly, I'm sick of hearing myself complain about it, so fuck it. No more complaints this year.<br /><br />I've been considering repurposing this site entirely as a professional sort of thing, a work blog/portfolio. I just haven't had the interest in blogging much, quite frankly. It seems too much effort for a gradually dwindling audience. (I look at my server stats.) And I've been very busy simply trying to survive and pay bills and, y'know, afford to eat daily.<br /><br />But I find myself reluctant to do that. What I <em>am</em> going to do, though, is start posting some real content. Now that I have my own apartment with my own recording studio, I'm trying to finish the album. (Really.) I'll be posting those tracks as I finish them here -- I'm not going to wait to have everything done -- so you can expect to hear a couple of them in the near future, tracks that are already done. And I've been writing new stuff and totally reworking old stuff as well.<br /><br />I'm also rebuilding my design portfolio and adding some recent work. And I think I'm going to be adding a design sandbox to the site -- an area where I can post experiments, personal projects, Actionscript and Processing stuff, links to inspirational or interesting stuff I find. This might actually take the form of an entirely separate work blog.<br /><br />I have a suspicion that I've lost work recently because of my public profile on the Internet -- I think that a couple of potential employers have found this site and been offended or made uncomfortable by what's on here. Which is unfortunate, but I couldn't fix that now even if I wanted to, thanks to things like the Wayback Machine and Google's cache. Everything you say is out there somewhere, and I'm willing to take full responsibility for that. You can accuse me of a lot of failings, which I'll willing admit to, but one thing I am not is duplicitious. I am who I am, and I accept the consequences of that.<br /><br />But it <em>does</em> mean that I'm going to have to figure out new ways of generating revenue. Y'all have been incredibly helpful with that over the years, and don't think it doesn't go appreciated -- some of you have dropped me cash simply because you enjoy what I do, and that cash has paid the bills or the rent or bought a cupboard full of groceries a few very important times. So thank you for that.<br /><br />And I want to continue. I want to give you your money's worth, even if you haven't or wouldn't send any my way. So: more music, more content, more value. And, frankly, a PayPal donation button and an Amazon wish list, because I've got to pay the bills somehow, and I'd rather do it writing and making art and music if I can.<br /><br />Christ, I can't even remember if I've mentioned my apartment -- the first solo apartment I've had since San Francisco in the mid-late '90s. It's a two bedroom that I'm getting from a friend at a great price -- which allows me to have my office/studio, which I desperately needed. I'm right near UNLV and quite happy with my situation. It's so wonderful to not be a loser living with one's parents; to feel proud of paying the bills, even if I have to stress all the time and spend all my hours trying to find work.<br /><br />I'm not good at anything else. I'm terrible at office jobs. I try, I do, but I just suck at sitting in a cubicle. I can't think, and if I can't think, I can't be creative, and being creative is what I do. I do better work in my own little office, in my own environment.<br /><br />Which reminds me: I'm thinking of hanging out a shingle as a new media consultant. Tricky gig in these economic times, I know...but I think most of you will admit that I know as much about online music and media as anybody else, and that I've been pretty successful in predicting trends, even if I'm a couple of years ahead of myself.<br /><br />I'd like some advice on this, if you have any. It's part of the reason I want to build a work blog -- I want to build a useful set of information that also shows that I actually know what I'm doing. Which I do. I just don't have enough of a public track record.<br /><br />Oh, and there's another project in the works that I don't want to talk about. Well, it's actually an old project I've revived. Music related. And I'm doing a lot of thinking about collective culture-making, and the various roles of producers (i.e. people who make stuff) vs. enablers (people who make ways to make that stuff available) vs. curators (people who filter through the crappy stuff to find the good stuff). Curatorship is, I think, the key to the next Web revolution...and I'm working on some stuff in that department right now.<br /><br />Anyway, that's my chatty little update. I'm going to go make myself some jambalaya and try to figure out how to properly hook up the wiring on my new dryer, which has a cable that's about 8 inches too short to reach the outlet. I feel a trip to Home Depot coming on, or at least Wal-Mart.<br /><br />And let me say it now: I really hope you're all doing well for the holidays. This is a dark moment for the world, but there's hope. There's always hope.<br /><br />Cheers.</p>",

Add bacon. When bacon starts to brown, add garlic and onions.<br /><br />Boil water for the pasta and put the pasta in it. Cook to preference.<br /><br />When garlic gets aromatic, add red wine and mushrooms. Let this cook down for a while -- it'll thicken as the oil and the wine combine with the starch in the garlic and the mushrooms.<br /><br />When you've got something that's not really thick but kinda thick, get two bowls. Strain the juice into one bowl and put the bacon, garlic, onion and mushroom solid stuff in another.<br /><br />Pour the juice back into your pan and add the butter. When the butter's all melted, add the flour and stir it with a wooden spoon until it's evenly mixed. Pour the milk in. Mix it around. Let it simmer for a couple of minutes, but WATCH IT. Don't let it bubble up and get all scalded.<br /><br />When it's just starting to bubble, throw your solids back in and mix it up. Take it off heat, strain your pasta, pour the sauce in the pasta (or vice versa) and mix that shit like you're DJ Danger Mouse.<br /><br />Bob's your uncle.</p>",

In Vegas, we're mostly known for taking pictures at clubs and events and posting them on the site.<br /><br />As content director, I'm hoping to make Mojo as good as any music-based news and info site out there, if not better. And I'm starting with the <a href=\"http://content.mojorepublik.com/blog\">Daily Mojo</a>, our music blog. I'll be posting new music, events, news and info there daily -- in fact, I'll probably be posting any music-related stuff I'd otherwise be posting here over there. I'm limited in the sense that I'm one dude with 24 hours a day in which to post stuff (along with my other work), but as time goes on, we'll be expanding.<br /><br />So check it out and let me know what you think, and sign up for the site while you're there. It makes me look good. ;-)</p>",

who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time; who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.<br /><br />It's the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches in numbers this nation has never seen; by people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the very first time in their lives, because they believed that <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">this</span> time must be different; that their voice could <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">be</span> that difference.<br /><br />It's the answer spoken by young and old, rich and poor, Democrat and Republican, black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, disabled and not disabled - Americans who sent a message to the world that we have never been a collection of Red States and Blue States: we are, and always will be, the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">United</span> States of America.<br /><br />It's the answer that led those who have been told for so long by so many to be cynical, and fearful, and doubtful of what we can achieve to put their hands on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope of a better day.<br /><br />It's been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this day, in this election, at this defining moment, change has come to America.<br /><br />I just received a very gracious call from Senator McCain.  He fought long and hard in this campaign, and he's fought even longer and harder for the country he loves.  He has endured sacrifices for America that most of us cannot begin to imagine, and we are better off for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader.  I congratulate him and Governor Palin for all they have achieved, and I look forward to working with them to renew this nation's promise in the months ahead.<br /><br />I want to thank my partner in this journey, a man who campaigned from his heart and spoke for the men and women he grew up with on the streets of Scranton and rode with on that train home to Delaware, the Vice President-elect of the United States, Joe Biden.<br /><br />I would not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my best friend for the last sixteen years, the rock of our family and the love of my life, our nation's next First Lady, Michelle Obama.  Sasha and Malia, I love you both so much, and you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House.  And while she's no longer with us, I know my grandmother is watching, along with the family that made me who I am.  I miss them tonight, and know that my debt to them is beyond measure.<br /><br />To my campaign manager David Plouffe, my chief strategist David Axelrod, and the best campaign team ever assembled in the history of politics - you made this happen, and I am forever grateful for what you've sacrificed to get it done.<br /><br />But above all, I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to - it belongs to you.<br /><br />I was never the likeliest candidate for this office.  We didn't start with much money or many endorsements.  Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington - it began in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the front porches of Charleston.<br /><br />It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give five dollars and ten dollars and twenty dollars to this cause.  It grew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation's apathy; who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the doors of perfect strangers; from the millions of Americans who volunteered, and organized, and proved that more than two centuries later, a government of the people, by the people and for the people has not perished from this Earth.  This is your victory.<br /><br />I know you didn't do this just to win an election and I know you didn't do it for me.  You did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead.  For even as we celebrate tonight, we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime - two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century.  Even as we stand here tonight, we know there are brave Americans waking up in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives for us.  There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after their children fall asleep and wonder how they'll make the mortgage, or pay their doctor's bills, or save enough for college.  There is new energy to harness and new jobs to be created; new schools to build and threats to meet and alliances to repair.<br /><br />The road ahead will be long.  Our climb will be steep.  We may not get there in one year or even one term, but America - I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there.  I promise you - we as a people will get there.<br /><br />There will be setbacks and false starts.  There are many who won't agree with every decision or policy I make as President, and we know that government can't solve every problem.  But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face.  I will listen to you, especially when we disagree.  And above all, I will ask you join in the work of remaking this nation the only way it's been done in America for two-hundred and twenty-one years - block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand.<br /><br />What began twenty-one months ago in the depths of winter must not end on this autumn night. This victory alone is not the change we seek - it is only the chance for us to make that change.  And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were.  It cannot happen without you.<br /><br />So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism; of service and responsibility where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves, but each other.  Let us remember that if this financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers - in this country, we rise or fall as one nation; as one people.<br /><br />Let us resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long.  Let us remember that it was a man from this state who first carried the banner of the Republican Party to the White House - a party founded on the values of self-reliance, individual liberty, and national unity.  Those are values we all share, and while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight, we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress.  As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours, \"We are not enemies, but friends...though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection.\"  And to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn - I may not have won your vote, but I hear your voices, I need your help, and I will be your President too.<br /><br />And to all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of our world - our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand.  To those who would tear this world down - we will defeat you.  To those who seek peace and security - we support you.  And to all those who have wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright - tonight we proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from our the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity, and unyielding hope.<br /><br />For that is the true genius of America - that America can change.  Our union can be perfected.  And what we have already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow.<br /><br />This election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations.  But one that's on my mind tonight is about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta.  She's a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election except for one thing - Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years old.<br /><br />She was born just a generation past slavery; a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two reasons - because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin.<br /><br />And tonight, I think about all that she's seen throughout her century in America - the heartache and the hope; the struggle and the progress; the times we were told that we can't, and the people who pressed on with that American creed:  Yes we can.<br /><br />At a time when women's voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot.  Yes we can.<br /><br />When there was despair in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal, new jobs and a new sense of common purpose.  Yes we can.<br /><br />When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a democracy was saved.  Yes we can.<br /><br />She was there for the buses in Montgomery, the hoses in Birmingham, a bridge in Selma, and a preacher from Atlanta who told a people that \"We Shall Overcome.\"  Yes we can.<br /><br />A man touched down on the moon, a wall came down in Berlin, a world was connected by our own science and imagination.  And this year, in this election, she touched her finger to a screen, and cast her vote, because after 106 years in America, through the best of times and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change.  Yes we can.<br /><br />America, we have come so far.  We have seen so much.  But there is so much more to do.  So tonight, let us ask ourselves - if our children should live to see the next century; if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see?  What progress will we have made?<br /><br />This is our chance to answer that call.  This is our moment.  This is our time - to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids; to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the American Dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth - that out of many, we are one; that while we breathe, we hope, and where we are met with cynicism, and doubt, and those who tell us that we can't, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people:<br /><br />Yes We Can.  Thank you, God bless you, and may God Bless the United States of America.</p>",

So instead, I'm going to reach out to those of you who are both conservative and who read this blog.<br /><br />Your Right and my Left are far less important than the task before us: rebuilding America, her economy and her diplomacy. These last eight years are a nightmare which we are finally awakening from. Let us take our lessons from those years -- let us learn that hatred and divisiveness and greed will bring us to the edge of disaster. We've tried the Bush Doctrine, the Bush economy, and it has failed us miserably. You don't need to be a liberal or a conservative to see that.<br /><br />What we have tried has failed. So let's try something new. Let's see what happens when we take your tax money and apply it towards health care for uninsured Americans instead of more guns. Let's see where diplomacy takes us. Let's see what happens when we erase the partisan lines drawn in the sand by an entire generation of political operatives who have played upon our fears and told us that we are surrounded by enemies, foreign and domestic.<br /><br />Let's stop trying to find those enemies. Let us find friends.<br /><br />I feel more hope right now than I ever have in my lifetime that we can move ahead and build the America that we deserve -- my America, your America, an America that can stand before the world and be proud.<br /><br />So let's get to it, shall we?</p>",

They wanted to have their first dance to it, but the original is way too fast and indie rawk to slow dance to.<br /><br />I've put together a massive orchestral version that has taken a very long time to put together. I arranged the song with a Brian Eno-style piano, pizzicato strings, bowed bass, a Moog, a Hammond Organ, a horn and woodwind section, plus loud distorted guitar. Tonight, I had Kiva Singh and Thom Chrastka and his lovely new lady friend Rosalie (I think that's the right spelling) come by and record backup vocals, layers and layers of 'em.<br /><br />All told, there's something like fifty audio tracks in Reason (or will be, once I've got the drums separated to be mixed individually) plus three submixes (instruments, guitars and backup vocals) and a reverb track. It's the most complicated thing I've ever done musically, incredibly hard to mix (trying to harmoniously blend 50 audio tracks is like herding cattle) and it sounds exceedingly lovely. The background vocals are <em>awesome</em>; it sounds not so much like a choir but maybe a high school gym full of people singing the song.<br /><br />If Alex and Laurenn are okay with it, I'll post it sometime after the wedding (which is on Saturday) so you can hear it. I'm monstrously proud of it.<br /><br />Now, back to mixing.</p>",

He does seem to have a sense of smell though, as he is shown in the 2002 MYP series attempting to block his nose when <a title=\"Stinkor\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stinkor\">Stinkor</a> appears before him to beg a boon, which has some logic as his skull would still have nasal passages permitting him to breathe, if he in fact still needs to. Ironically, when shown as Keldor in flashbacks from the 2002 cartoon, the character's distinctive nasal voice (a sound-alike of <a title=\"Alan Oppenheimer\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Oppenheimer\">Alan Oppenheimer</a>'s original portrayal) is markedly <em>less</em> nasal than as Skeletor, despite actually <em>having a nose</em>.

He's trying to raise $1000.<br /><br />I'm not in any position to help him right now, as regular readers probably guessed, but if you know Gregory, you might want to get in contact with him at doctorgogol (at) yahoo (dot) com and help him out if you can.<br /><br />I can personally vouch for Gregory -- this isn't some lazy person panhandling on the Web, but a good guy who's gotten into a bad situation not of his own making.

Sitting here in Thom's apartment at three in the morning last night, I plugged his Stratocaster into something called a Peavey Valverb (which does tremolo and reverb), and it sounded exactly right. So I did four guitar tracks, and tonight whilst at a barbecue I dropped in drums and a synth pad. And it's <em>perfect</em>, exactly the way I hear it in my head. Minus lead guitar and vocal and maybe some piano, but it's there.<br /><br />I really want to finish recording it so I can share it with you.</p>",

It doesn't work<br /><br />14. It doesn't work because you couldn't get a hold of a 220-to-110 volt converter/110-to-220 volt converter/PAL-to-NTSC/NTSC-to-PAL scan converter/serial-to-usb adapter/\"dongle\" of any sort..and the town you're in is simply not the kind of place that has/cares about such things<br /><br />13. Your audience looks under/behind your table/pedestal/false wall/drop ceiling or follows wires to find out \"where the camera is\"<br /><br />12. Someone either on their blog or across the room is prattling on about the shifting relations between producers and consumers..and mentions your project<br /><br />11. Your audience \"interacts\" by clapping/hooting/making bird calls/flapping their arms like a duck or waving their arms wildly while standing in front of a wall onto which is projected squiggly lines<br /><br />10. Your audience asks amongst themselves, \"how does it work?\"<br /><br />9. The exhibition curators insist that you spend hours standing by your own wall text so that you can explain to attendees \"how it works\"<br /><br />8. It's just like using your own normal, human, perfectly good eyeballs, only the resolution sucks and the colors are really lousy..plus the heat from the CPU fan is blowing on your forehead which makes you really uncomfortable and schvitz-y<br /><br />7. Someone in your audience wearing a Crumpler bag, slinging a fancy digital SLR and/or standing with their arms folded smugly says, \"Yeah..yeah, I could've done that too..c'mon dude..some Perlin Noise? And Processing/Ruby-on-Rails/AJAX/Blue LEDs/MaxMSP/An Infrared Camera/Lots of Free Time/etc.? Pfft..It's <em>so</em> easy...\"<br /><br />6. Someone in your audience, maybe the same guy with the Crumpler bag and digital SLR excitedly says, \"Oh, dude. That should <em>totally</em> be a Facebook app!\"<br /><br />5. It's called a \"project\" and not a \"piece of art\"<br /><br />4. You saw the \"project\" <em>years</em> ago...and here it is again...now with multi-touch interaction and other fancy digital bells and Web 2.0-y whistles<br /><br />3. Your audience cups their hands over various proturbances/orifices at or nearby your project attempting to confuse/interact with the camera/sensor/laser beam, even if it uses no such technology<br /><br />2. There's a noticeable preponderance of smoothly shifting red, green and blue lighting effects<br /><br />1. People wonder if it wasn't all really done in Photoshop, anyway</p>",

            "source": {
                "content": "<p>Jack Womack is one of speculative fiction's secret treasures. His 1995 novel <a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net/2008/07/25/jack-womacks-underap.html\"><em>Random Acts Of Senseless Violence</em></a> is one of the most remarkable and emotionally affecting works I've ever read and the seed of my thinking about the whole <a href=\"http://jwz.livejournal.com/543348.html\">Grim Meathook Future</a> thing.It's not science fiction, per se; it's the story of how American civilization sputters out over the course of a year or two, told from the perspective of the diary of a 12 year old girl who slowly, subtly transforms from innocent child of the upper-middle-class to an almost feral street urchin. It's gorgeous and heartbreaking and as powerful in its way as <em>Lord Of The Flies</em> or even <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>.<br /><br />I recently emailed Jack and asked him if I could do a short email interview with him. He very graciously agreed, and here's the result.<br /><br /><strong>jze:</strong> <em>Random Acts Of Senseless Violence</em> is part of your \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Ambient-Womack-Jack/dp/0802134947\">Ambient</a>\" series, and yet it seems to stand alone as its own work. Where did the idea for this come from? Did you want to write a sort of prologue to the other books, or did it begin life as a separate work? How did you, basically, come up with the idea for Lola's story?<br /><br /><strong>jw:</strong> <em>Random</em>, like all the books in the series is intended to both be mostly read on its own (the final volume <em>Going, Going, Gone</em> being the only one really requiring that the others have been read in order to fully appreciate everything about it) and as part of the overall series, in <em>Random</em>'s case to serve as the gateway to the others in turn -- <em>Heathern</em>, <em>Ambient</em>, <em>Terraplane</em>, <em>Elvissey</em>, <em>Going</em>. The intention, for the overall reader, is to make the dialects in the later books more comprehensible. <em></em><br /><br /><em>Random</em> was conceived as part of the whole; as the introduction to the world as well as the word, this particular part told by a young girl at the verge of enormous changes physically, emotionally, and socially; ideally the reader, like she, is changed between the first sentence and the last.<br /><br />As I've noted in earlier interviews, the essential figure of Lola Hart is patterned on how I imagined a friend of mine was when she was 12; after I did the first twenty pages or so I showed it to her and said does this sound OK so far, insofar as a 12-year old girl growing up in your neighborhood in NYC would sound? And she said yep. And from there she and the other characters took on their own lives.<br /><br /><strong>jze:</strong> It does certainly have an authentic-sounding voice; it's one of the strengths of the novel that you can't hear an adult behind the child's voice.<br /><br />The book describes a society that seems to be going out with a whimper, not a bang. How did you envision the subtle way in which <em>Random</em>'s America falls apart? Was it inspired by any specific thinkers / schools of thought?<br /><br /><strong>jw: </strong>Essentially I took current events and projected possible futures, finally picking the one that seemed, unfortunately, likeliest.<br /><br />There is in fact considerable going on that is not good in the background in <em>Random</em>, but it's not on Lola's eye level yet. At the same time, most of the characters in the novel try to adapt to their society in flux to the same degree that we try to adapt to ours; and they, like we, find themselves more and more concussed rather than enlightened by the pace of change.<br /><br />Never would have foreseen that NYC would have been so regooded so thoroughly, however.<br /><br /><strong>jze: </strong>One of the most interesting aspects of <em>Random</em>, to me, is that not only Lola but most of the characters don't seem to really understand how bad things are getting, other than Lola's father, perhaps. How far do you think things have to go -- how bad do they have to be -- before people start to wake up and realize that some line has been crossed? At what point do people finally say \"Oh, shit\" and start noticing?<br /><br /><strong>jw: </strong>It takes an extremely long time for members of any given society to wake up and realize what lines have been crossed while they weren't looking. A majority of members have to be directly, and unpleasantly, affected by ongoing or new events in order for any response to begin reaching critical mass. And, those prone to optimism are going to see everything as well as they possibly can, for as long as they can. Sometimes the optimism will be justified.<br /><br /><strong>jze: </strong>Let's talk for a second about the language of <em>Random</em>: obviously, one of the most intriguing things about the work is the way Lola's language sort of devolves from beginning to end. How did you approach the idea of this? The slang she uses is, I assume, mostly invented by you: how did you go about creating a realistic patois?<br /><br /><strong>jw: </strong>The point of the language transformations in all of the books in this series was to give the reader a direct idea of the mental and emotional differences between these folks of a possible near-future and ourselves; the point being that as events transpired ever faster, so language and internal thought would transform as well -- not within a matter of months or a few years in actuality, but over the course of time (this, like the title of the book, has been taken too literally by some readers and critics.)<br /><br />Lola's voice in <em>Random</em> reveals her own emotional and mental tranformations as she adapts to her new circumstances and allows herself access to emotions she's never tapped before. By the end of the book, the reader has not only seen one additional way in which Lola transforms (as well as the way through which the other transformations are made evident) but should be used to reading the adapted language well enough to proceed to the succeeding books with much less trouble in understanding them.<br /><br />As to how I made it up, I can only say I played it by ear -- if it sounded right in the head, that's how it went down on the page.<br /><br />(<em>Thanks again to Jack Womack, both for the interview and the great work!</em>)</p>",

But many of these companies have abandoned the field. “Eli Lilly and Company developed the first cephalosporins,” Moellering told me, referring to familiar drugs like Keflex. “They developed a huge number of important anti-microbial agents. They had incredible chemistry and incredible research facilities, and, unfortunately, they have completely pulled out of it now. After Squibb merged with Bristol-Myers, they closed their antibacterial program,” he said, as did Abbott, which developed key agents in the past treatment of gram-negative bacteria. A recent assessment of progress in the field, from U.C.L.A., concluded, “FDA approval of new antibacterial agents decreased by 56 per cent over the past 20 years (1998-2002 vs. 1983-1987),” noting that, in the researchers’ projection of future development only six of the five hundred and six drugs currently being developed were new antibacterial agents. Drug companies are looking for blockbuster therapies that must be taken daily for decades, drugs like Lipitor, for high cholesterol, or Zyprexa, for psychiatric disorders, used by millions of people and generating many billions of dollars each year. Antibiotics are used to treat infections, and are therefore prescribed only for days or weeks. (The exception is the use of antibiotics in livestock, which is both a profit-driver and a potential cause of antibiotic resistance.)</blockquote><br />From <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/08/11/080811fa_fact_groopman\">\"Superbugs\"</a>, a rather scary article in <em>The New Yorker</em>.</p>",

It's a black 49cc Schwinn (I didn't know they made scooters either) and it's surprisingly cool-looking. I mean, it's not a Vespa, but it's not total crap, either.<br /><br />I rode it from the Coffee Bean to my parents' house and back, and then to the Griffin on Fremont Street, and then to the Double Down, and then back to the apartment, and then to Wal-Mart on Eastern and Russell, and then back. No crazy drivers, no problems, so far, cross your fingers for me. It's hella fun to ride, actually, even if it won't go more than 30 miles per hour with me on it.<br /><br />I went to Wal-Mart to get an extra chain and lock for it; Mike gave me a combination lock/chain for it, but this neighborhood is ghetto fabulous. There's a steel pylon with a little loop on it that works perfectly for locking it up, but I'm just paranoid, so I've got both wheels chained and locked to the loop, plus the front wheel is locked at a 45º angle, so hopefully nobody will jack it. Better safe than sorry, right?<br /><br />The best moment of the evening was riding it up the cobblestone ramp onto the front porch of the Double Down at 5 mph and parking it at the end of a row of Harleys and Triumphs. The looks I got from the punks outside were fucking <em>awesome</em>.<br /><br />So you may find the idea of my giant ass on a scooter funny. Feel free. You know what else is funny? Even with me on it, this fucker gets like 80 miles to the gallon. So when I see you dropping a Benjamin in your big-ass gas tank, that'll be funny. I'll laugh.<br /><br />And now I have to get a bunch of The Who and The Jam stickers for it. I'm going to be Modtastic. And I'm totally going to say \"Ciao!\" as I pull away from people. Heh heh heh.</p>",

The most vile fucking redneck Religious Right crusader asshole is just me with a different set of parents and a different collection of DVDs. The crackhead on the corner is also me, although admittedly me if I were somehow dumb enough to get hooked on crack, which I'm not. (Maybe his DVD collection didn't include <em>New Jack City</em>.

Some of us, I really think, need to get kicked off the face of the fucking planet. (Like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Kony\">Joseph Kony</a>. And <a href=\"http://achewood.com/index.php?date=07052007\">the guy who invented Comic Sans</a>.) But most of us, I think, are doing what we can to survive. We may not all be doing our best -- hell, most of us probably don't know what our best is, or that we're even capable of it -- but we're doing what we can. You can't really hate us for that.<br /><br />Except <a href=\"http://rofl.wheresthebeef.co.uk/Emo%20Kid%2001.jpg\">emo kids</a>. Fuck them.

                "content": "<p>A lot of people have been linking to Warren's post \"<a href=\"http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=6068\">The Patchwork Years</a>\". I thought you might be interested in something I emailed him back in January, which is my take on the ideas he's exploring in his post. (Which is to say, great minds think alike.) I think this email was occasioned by <a href=\"http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=5509\">this post of his</a>, at least by the date (January 27th) and the email subject, which is \"lifestreaming\".<br /><br />An aside here: I notice that a lot of the stuff of mine that people seem to read and think about the most tends to be correspondence or posts on message boards. No point, just an observation.<br /><br />--<br /><br />The problem, of course, is that information without context is useless. It's ephemera, gomi, what T.S. Eliot called \"<a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/201/1.html\">a heap of broken images</a>\". Sometimes this is amusing in a pomo sort of way -- the juxtaposition of unrelated images and the forced perception of meaning within them is one of the particular centerfolds that postmodernists jerk off to. But most of the time, it's no more useful than a schizophrenic's notebook of random thoughts. (Which, if you've ever perused one, you'll know is usually a lot more tedious than most people would think.)<br /><br />A lot of this lifestreaming stuff -- at least the part of it that is public -- strikes me as unforgivable narcissism. My life just isn't that interesting, even to me, and neither is anyone else's. I do see the practical value of tracking your own movements and your own stuff, but only to a point. [Bruce] Sterling's <a href=\"http://ocaption.blogspot.com/2006/03/bruce-sterlings-state-of-world-address_22.html\">old line about finding your shoes</a> always cracks me up. How fucking hard is it to find your goddamn shoes? Do you really need a high-technological solution for that problem? And this is coming from someone who loses his shoes regularly. (I keep a messy house.) Does the world really need a self-portrait of you every day? Or twenty? Does anybody really need to know that you've decided to move your laptop from your living room into your bedroom, because you just feel like working in bed?<br /><br />Or the precise nature of your relationship with each of your social network friends? That's what irritates me about Facebook -- I never answer that dumb little \"How do you know this person?\" survey, because I just don't care and don't want to have to think about it. And I refuse to break something shaded and ambiguous and interesting down into a tick in a little box. How do I know this girl who's befriending me? She used to date my friend, then I had a crush on her, then she sort of had a crush on me, but she decided not to get involved with me and started dating one of my other friends, so I stopped talking to her for a while...how the fuck do you incorporate that into a database? And why would you want to?<br /><br />I think in many ways that these are solutions in search of a problem. I don't begrudge the people who are trying to come up with problems to be solved, but it doesn't interest me much. I love technology, but I think there are more interesting and far less wanky things to do with it.<br /><br />To play devil's advocate against myself: perhaps the problem is editing. There's a reason that films don't usually follow a character in a single shot for two hours. Most of life is dull. The idea I always liked about your feedsite listeners in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmetropolitan\"><i>Transmet</i></a> was that, presumably, there were enough of them that at any given time, something interesting might be happening...and that they only started transmitting when it was. It's like my family's habit (starting with my late grandfather, and carrying through me) of leaving CNN Headline News on all day, which repeats roughly every hour until something interesting happens. It's <a href=\"http://continuouspartialattention.jot.com/WikiHome\">continuous partial attention</a> -- you leave it on in the background, and when, say, the Monte Carlo Hotel catches on fire <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/01/25/vegas.fire/index.html\">as it did yesterday</a>, you look up and pay attention.<br /><br />Editing. Context. This is the true value proposition on the Net anymore. We've got more information than we know what to do with. Now we need curators. (We always did. This is what newspapers and magazines and record labels and publishers used to do for us -- pick out the interesting things out of the shit pile and bring it to our attention. Of course, we didn't always agree with them and there were never enough options. But there are now.)<br /><br />This is what YOU do, my friend, on the Internet. People read your blog because they like your writing. They think you have good ideas about what's interesting and good, ideas that extend beyond comics and novels. So you are a trusted contextualizer. When you post about a band you like or a blog you dig or what have you, your opinion is weighted by the whole context of who you are and how you think. Context is what you bring to the table, and that creates what I once called a \"<a href=\"http://www.mindjack.com/feature/tastetribes.html\">taste tribe</a>\" -- people who respect your cultural context and trust you to tell them what's good, at least most of the time. You're a node in a network that includes <a href=\"http://www.blackbeltjones.com/work/\">Matt Jones</a> and Ben Templesmith and the <a href=\"http://coilhouse.net/\">Coilhouse</a> girls and me and Cory Doctorow and Bruce Sterling and all the rest of us who trust one another's tastes and context, to greater or lesser extent.<br /><br />And knowing about your jerky is much less interesting than your story about the jerky. The story is what you bring to the table.<br /><br />I think.<br /></p>",

Behind his eyes is a vision of an entire classroom of children, hurling crumpled-up paper balls and shouting \"Toady! Toady!

I don't buy AAC music from the iTunes Store, so to be honest I kinda forgot until I found it in my wallet and decided to rent a movie tonight. I got <em>Starship Troopers</em>, which I'd actually never seen. (I know, I know.)<br /><br />Video quality was perfectly fine, though it stuttered and stopped working about 21 minutes in, which seemed to be because I had Firefox open with a bunch of tabs. I killed it and had no more problems. It streamed faster than it played, which was cool, though I gave it about five minutes after commencing download before I hit play.<br /><br />All in all, I like the experience, and I'll probably rent more movies this way. My only complaint is that the iTunes Store rental selection is a bit limited. I've just seen most of what they've got.<br /><br />The thing Apple was gambling on -- that someone like me would be willing to drop $2.99 to watch a movie rather than BitTorrent it illegally -- seems to work. I don't know that I'd have paid for the rental if I didn't have a gift card, but if I wasn't broke, I probably would, actually.<br /><br />I'll probably rent <em>Jesus Camp</em> next.</p>",

A blogger named Violet Blue noticed that we unpublished some posts related to her. Some people wanted to know why.<br /><br />Bottom line is that those posts (<em>not</em> \"more than 100 posts,\" as erroneously claimed elsewhere) were removed from public view a year ago. Violet behaved in a way that made us reconsider whether we wanted to lend her any credibility or associate with her. It's our blog and so we made an editorial decision, like we do every single day. We didn't attempt to silence Violet. We <a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net/policies.html\" target=\"_blank\">unpublished</a> our own work. There's a big difference between that and censorship.<br /><br />We hope you'll respect our choice to keep the reasons behind this private. We do understand the confusion this caused for some, especially since we fight hard for openness and transparency. We were trying to do the right thing quietly and respectfully, without embarrassing the parties involved.<br /><br />Clearly, that didn't work out. In attempting to defuse drama, we inadvertently ignited more. Mind you, we weren't the ones splashing gasoline around; but we did make the fire possible. We're sorry about that. In the meantime, Boing Boing's past content is <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.boingboing.net\" target=\"_blank\">indexed on the Wayback Machine</a>, a basic Internet resource; so the material should still be available for those who would like to read it.<br /><br />Thank you all for caring what happens on Boing Boing. And if you think there's more to say, by all means, let's talk. We're listening.</blockquote><br />I believe this was a terrible mistake on the part of Boing Boing, and I'd like to explain why. I want to do so not just as a goofy dude with a blog, but as someone who's been blogging personally and professionally for almost a decade and as a professional print journalist who's been working on the boundary between old and new media since the mid-1990s.<br /><br />I feel the need to point out a few things, first, so you know where I'm coming from: I do not know Violet Blue. I have never read any of Ms. Blue's writing -- not out of distaste, but more out of disinterest in her chosen topics, which has nothing to do with the merits or lack thereof of her work. Therefore I cannot champion or dismiss her. This is not about the particulars of Ms. Blue's writing, or her personal behavior, of which I know almost nothing.<br /><br />I <em>do</em> know some of the Boing Boing people -- I met <a href=\"http://boingboing.net/markf.html\">Mark Fraunfelder</a> and interviewed his lovely and charming wife Carla Sinclair at their home many years ago, I've known <a href=\"http://craphound.com/\">Cory Doctorow</a> slightly for several years, and <a href=\"http://pesco.net/\">David Pescovitz</a> and I both worked on an online publication called <em>Revolting!</em> back in the late 90s, though I doubt David would remember meeting me. Mark has also published my writing in <em>Make</em>. I don't know Xeni Jardin or Teresa Nielsen Hayden, but like Violet Blue, we have mutual acquaintances and friends, and from all accounts they are extremely bright and nice and talented people.<br /><br />By and large, I like and respect these people, even though I often disagree vehemently with Cory's positions on intellectual property rights. I wanted to make sure that this was understood, so that this wasn't seen as a personal attack. I wish the Boingers all the best.<br /><br />Having said that, I do believe they've made a bad decision, and I would feel remiss if I didn't explain why, in hopes that my reasoning might persuade them.<br /><br />By making the decision to remove Ms. Blue from their archives, Boing Boing has, intentionally or otherwise, made the following statements:<br /><ol><br /><li>As bloggers, we do not have the responsibilities of a professional media outlet.</li><br /><li>We do not feel the need to discuss our policies with our readers.</li><br /><li>We reserve the right to hide behind our terms of service.</li><br /></ol><br />I'll address these points one by one.<br /><br /><strong>1. As bloggers, we do not have the responsibilities of a professional media outlet<em>.</em></strong> In the unfashionable world of \"old media\", it would be considered a massive breach of ethics to remove all references to a person from one's archives based on personal, professional or even ideological disagreements. It's the sort of thing that would literally destroy a publication's credibility. This holds just as true for the <a href=\"http://www.stuffmagazine.com/\">silliest bubblegum trend magazine</a> as <a href=\"http://www.nytco.com/press/ethics.html\">it does for the <em>New York Times</em></a>.<br /><br />Boing Boing is not, as Ms. Hayden says, the <em>New York Times</em>. It's a for-profit group blog. But by admitting that they are unwilling to behave in a fashion that adheres to the very basic ethics of journalism that have evolved over centuries, they are also declaring themselves free of the credibility and trust that comes with that adherence. How can you trust a site whose staff feels it's acceptable to remove people wholesale from their archives?<br /><br />Of course, they're quite welcome to do this. It's their site. But due to the site's incredible popularity and visibility -- it ranks consistently as <a href=\"http://www.technorati.com/pop/blogs/\">one of the top five most-linked-to blogs</a> on the Net -- it has become a sort of role model for the blogosphere at large. Boing Boing is a flagship. As a flagship, their ethics and behavior ought to be better than that of anyone else.<br /><br />Sadly, as they have shown here, this is not the case. And because of their position, their bad decision reflects upon blogging as a whole. It undermines blogging's ability to be taken seriously and to stand with \"old\" media.<br /><br />This removal also underlines one of the biggest problems with online media: the mutability of the past. If Boing Boing had simply decided not to ever link to or mention Ms. Blue again, so be it. I wouldn't even personally consider that to be unethical. They're not a wholesale news outlet and they choose what they wish to cover.<br /><br />But removing her entirely from their archives -- which are part of the collective memory of the Internet -- is far more pernicious. It's a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retconned\">retcon</a>. It changes the history of Boing Boing's discourse. As far as anyone will ever know, browsing through their archives, Boing Boing <em>never</em> wrote about or linked to Violet Blue. And while this may seem like a relatively insignificant thing, it's hard not to think of Orwell. We are at war with Eastasia. We have <em>always</em> been at war with Eastasia. Boing Boing may not be able to make Violet Blue into an unperson, and it's ultimately a tempest in a teapot...but there's something disquieting about it, all the same.<br /><br />I have only ever intentionally unpublished a couple of entries on Zenarchery, and those were very specific cases where I'd posted something without thinking that compromised another person. My archives (now mostly vanished, thanks to a server error) were chock full of posts in which I compromised myself -- by discussing drug use or by simply ranting like an idiot. I contradicted myself constantly. I said things that I probably should have never said in a public forum, or even a private one, or standing by myself in an empty room.<br /><br />But I didn't delete those posts. I would have considered it cowardly and weaselly. I take responsibility for my own words and the things I choose to talk about and link to. And though I've occasionally deleted comments for being off-topic or for personally attacking me rather than attacking my statements or ideas, I would never remove someone wholesale from my blog just because I disagreed with them or because I had a personal problem with them.<br /><br />Perhaps that's just my anachronistic adherence to what I see as journalistic standards -- though Zenarchery is even less of a journalistic outlet than Boing Boing is -- but I think it's important to leave the past as past, and to take responsibility for things you have said that may come back to haunt you.<br /><br />Boing Boing is not lending Violet Blue credibility by maintaining their archive of links to her work. They're simply maintaining links to those things which they thought were notable in the past. If they really wanted to disgrace her or denounce her, they could have done so publicly. Or they could have written a post explaining why they no longer chose to associate themselves with her. But they didn't. They didn't have enough invested to proactively do something about their sudden change of heart. They just erased her from their world.<br /><br />Where does this end? I mean, Boing Boing has posted <a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net/2003/06/10/taste-tribes-smartmo.html\">links</a> to my <a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net/2006/04/06/netfunded-abomb-arti.html\">work</a> before. I've disagreed with them here in the past (and in the present, obviously). Are they going to remove their links to my stuff? Where do you draw that line?<br /><br />The correct answer, of course, is that you draw the line on this side of removing people from your site. You draw it hard and deep and you fill it with concrete and you build a wall above it and you put barbed wire and guard dogs on the wall and you never, ever cross it. Because what's on the other side of that wall, if you'll pardon my extended metaphor, is an extremely slippery slope, which leads to the road to Hell, which is paved with good intentions. (Heh.)<br /><br /><strong>2. We do not feel the need to discuss our policies with our readers.</strong> Though Ms. Hayden invites readers to talk about the situation now, the fact is that, as she also points out, this removal was in fact done <em>a year ago</em>. It was done without any discussion or announcement at the time, or apparently even any notification to Ms. Blue herself. (She might be lying, but since I don't know either way and nobody at Boing Boing has suggested otherwise, I'm going to assume she's telling the truth.)<br /><br />This goes against Boing Boing's stated goal of openness and transparency. It suggests that they were simply hoping nobody would notice the removal, which is just silly -- Boing Boing is, again, one of the most linked-to blogs on the Web, and surely they knew somebody would follow one of those links to a Violet Blue-related post and discover it was missing.<br /><br />That's a best-case scenario. The worst-case scenario is that they simply didn't care whether or not their readers came up against broken links and missing content and didn't know why. I doubt that's the case, but it's hard not to look at this situation and wonder.<br /><br />I can't think of a good way to go about excising someone from one's archives, because I think it's entirely wrong to do so in the first place. But doing so and not talking about it for a year does suggest a certain disdain for one's audience that I think is probably not the best approach for a site like Boing Boing.<br /><br /><strong>3. We reserve the right to hide behind our terms of service.</strong> This is the part that's the most infuriating for me, particularly as Boing Boing is chock full of posts slamming <a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net/2003/10/03/adsense-terms-of-ser.html\">software companies</a> and <a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net/2007/10/11/att-changes-terms-of.html\">connectivity providers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net/2005/03/14/aol-weasels-about-it.html\">media companies</a> for essentially doing the exact same thing -- limiting access to information or behaving badly and then shrugging when people complain and inviting them to read the fine print.<br /><br />Terms of service is a legalese thing -- it's designed to cover your ass when lawyers come calling or, at a distant second, when unhinged comment trolls begin complaining about \"censorship\". I don't think it's a breach of blogging ethics to delete comment spam or offensive lunatic rambling from one's sites (unless, as I said before, it's one's own lunatic rambling), and I don't think anyone else would think so either.<br /><br />But a site's boilerplate terms of service document is not designed to protect them from doing absurd things like removing people wholesale from the site. Do they have the legal right to do it? Sure. Do they have the First Amendment right to do it? Sure, Boing Boing is an American site. Does it still stink? Of course it does. As <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096438/quotes\">a famous thespian once said</a>, it stinks like yesterday's diapers, which is why Ms. Hayden had to bring up the TOS in the first place. A general rule of discourse is that whenever anybody actually has to state their terms of service to justify their actions, they're doing something shifty. They know you can't argue with them; all you can do is shake your head and walk away.<br /><br />I cannot imagine what Violet Blue did to justify this sort of behavior on Boing Boing's part. I've been trying to think of a situation in which I would do what they have done. Did Ms. Blue espouse genocide? Did she try to put a shiv in Doctorow's throat at a party? Did she involve herself in sexual shenanigans with some Boing Boing staffer? Did they catch her serially killing people, or selling crack to five year olds?<br /><br />I doubt it was anything so lurid. And it's absolutely none of my business, of course, or anyone else's. The only reason it comes to bear at all is so that one can weigh the justification of Boing Boing's action. What awful thing could someone do that would make it okay to remove them from one's site entirely?<br /><br />I can't think of anything. Not one thing. I've blogged about people who've hurt or betrayed me or done things I utterly disagreed with. I've blogged about people towards whom I have behaved in unacceptable ways that I am deeply embarrassed about. It would never even occur to me to simply remove any mention of them from Zenarchery. That just seems like a particularly pathetic form of revisionism. My past is my past, and I cannot deny the things I've done nor the things that have been done to me.<br /><br />What I do, of course, matters very little; I am not a big cog in the great clockwork that is Internet media. But Boing Boing is, and people look to them to see how to behave, whether they like it or not. Their decision to remove Violet Blue has undermined the entire medium they work in. It was a bad decision and I know they're better than that.<br /><br />I would hope that they would reconsider their actions and -- if technically feasible -- reverse them.<br />It's okay to make bad decisions. (At least, I hope it's okay, otherwise I'm in terrible trouble.) But the whole point is to learn from them.<br /><br />And maybe I'm wrong. Maybe the collective of Boing Boing readers and other bloggers don't think this is wrong. Information is ephemeral, after all. But if that's the case, it makes me very sad, because it suggests that we as a group of people building a new medium have <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism_ethics_and_standards\">a lot to learn</a> from the media we're trying to replace.</p>",

Quanta are <em>n</em>-dimensional objects that pass through a four-dimensional manifold at multiple points. Within that four-dimensional manifold, these objects are represented as multiple discrete objects that do not coincide within the manifold, though they may coincide in <em>n</em>-dimensional space. The state of this <em>n-</em>dimensional quanta is always internally consistent, but since it cannot be seen as a single object within that manifold, it appears to be <em>multiple non-coinciding objects with non-local coherence</em>.<br /><br />Does that make more sense? :-)<br /><br />(I'm still not sure if I'm explaining this properly. If you're a physicist or a topologist, it would be great if you could contact me via the contact form and explain which bits of this sound like complete nonsense. It's not, I assure you, but I may be using the wrong terminology for what I'm trying to convey.)</p>",

                "content": "<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement\">Quantum entanglement</a>: it occurred to me today that the only ways quantum entanglement works is if a) space-time is a four-dimensional object that is folded around itself in <em>n</em>-dimensional space (<em>n</em> being a number higher than four), and what appear to be two entangled quanta are not actually four-dimensional particles but a single <em>y</em>-dimensional (<em>y</em> being a number equal to or higher than <em>n</em>) structure which happen to pass through four-dimensional space in two different places.<br /><br />Or b) when the probability waveform of an entangled quanta collapses, it retcons the other particle's waveform, backwards in time, so that it appears that the two quanta's behavior is simultaneous -- \"spooky action at a distance\" -- when in fact, they are not. One follows the other. Just not in the direction we're expecting.<br /><br />Which makes me wonder about the whole concept of time and cause-and-effect. I wonder sometimes if the whole \"first cause, then effect\" thing isn't merely a function of how humans perceive time -- in a straight one-way line, when in fact that might not be the case at all. We may only <em>perceive</em> time as a one-way arrow. There's nothing in physics that insists that this must be true, famously. And perhaps unidirectional time is an epiphenomenon which only really happens at the Newtonian scale. We know that the flow of time is relative at Einsteinian scales (very big, very fast). And we know that cause-and-effect breaks down at a quantum level.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodinger%27s_cat\">Schrodinger's Cat</a>, for example, suggests that the observation of a quantum event collapses the probability waveform of that event: until one opens the box, the cat is neither alive nor dead. Both waveforms exist within the unobserved confines of the box.<br /><br />However, here's the interesting part: the cat doesn't suddenly live or die when you open the box. If the cat is dead, the cat has already <em>been</em> dead for a while by the time you open the box. But it's just as possible the cat is alive, and was alive the whole time.<br /><br />Which suggests that the act of observation -- which collapses the probability waveform inside the box -- not only changes the present, but the immediate past (i.e. all of the time since the experiment began and the cat was either killed or not killed). It suggests that cause-and-effect may be localized, inside the box and outside it.<br /><br />I'm very sleepy. I'm going to go to bed now.</p>",

That cracks me the fuck up.<br /><br />But it doesn't make it any cooler in here. It's really just like hot as hell, like 90º at 5 am. (It's also 5 fucking AM.

Apparently this is to fix the bizarre problem that this apartment (and apparently all of them) has: there's no cold water.<br /><br />I shit you not. The water that comes out of the tap is either hot or really hot. Not even lukewarm. The toilet water is hot. I swear to Christ. Sitting on the toilet is like treating your rectum to a day in a Turkish sauna. My ass is actually steam-cleaned and moisturized now. It's a completely inappropriate sensation.<br /><br />Anyway, they're fixing this, for an indefinite period of time.

And I can't hang out here today anyway, because there won't be any water to splash on myself to keep myself cool when the sun comes up and it hits 108º again. When that happens, taking three or four showers a day is the only solution. I got back last evening and I was covered in oily sweat within twenty minutes. It was disgusting. I felt like Mickey Rourke.<br /><br />Plus maintenance guys are showing up to do bangy, crashy things with the AC.<br /><br />At least I got my laundry done a few hours ago, so I won't look and smell like Gary Busey's ass as I haul my tired, sweaty, sunburnt ass out of the house in a few minutes, to walk down to the Coffee Bean and await its opening. Which won't be for at least an hour, hour and a half. But once the sun rises it's going to turn into fucking <em>Dune</em> both outside and inside, and at least there I'll have reliable wifi.<br /><br />Anybody wanna hire me at a lucrative web design job so I can go get my own apartment -- maybe something with a reliable source of running water and AC to keep the Mojave at bay? I swear to God, it's like I'm living in Tijuana, except without the cheap drugs.<br /><br />I think I'm wrong. I think there is a God. And I think he thinks I'm Seth Rogan.</p>",

It's not terribly complex, though it has stretched my understanding of Java a bit, which is nice.<br /><br />Basically, it loads an array of the steps of a scale -- for example, a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_key\">minor scale</a> is [0,2,3,5,7,8,10,12] steps from the root note. Then you feed it a root note and a length of note to generate -- eighth, quarter, etc. It then pipes this out as MIDI data.<br /><br />When that data is sent to Reason, and a bass beat is added and some delay, it sounds like this:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/generative-sample1.mp3\">Generative Sample</a> (0:32, MP3)<br /><br />This is two melodic passes -- one of eighth notes and one of quarter notes -- and one where it just went apeshit on a Dr. Rex sample that I fucked with violently. That's the clicky bit.<br /><br />Here's the weird part: it doesn't work exactly right. It has something, I'm sure, to do with the code I got from another Processing programmer to bypass Processing's framerate resolution. I changed it and, I feel sure, fucked it up somewhere, because now the tool occasionally spits out notes on some semi-random rhythm.<br /><br />But it sounds <em>cool</em> that way. I'm gonna teach it how to write basslines, next.<br /><br />Whaddya think of this? I think it sounds lovely and strange -- not random, precisely.</p>",

            "source": {
                "content": "<p>Beef stroganoff is one of those foods most often made by sad, single people or suburban housewives with too little free time for cooking. I myself am a sad, single person, but I've figured out a slight variation on the traditional Middle American stroganoff that is completely tasty, easy as hell to make, and only moderately bad for you. (Also cheap.)<br /><br />I suppose this is Hungarian in style, but I couldn't really say for sure -- these are the same ingredients (minus the sour cream) that I use to make spaghetti sauce and chili with as well. It's pan-ethnic, I guess. Fuck it. Who cares? Make it, eat it, make your stomach happy.<br /><br />This isn't a first date dish. (Who cooks for a first date, anyway? And what kind of idiot goes to a stranger's house to eat on a first date, for that matter? You could be hanging out with fucking Gilles de Rais, for all you know.) Unless you tend to date girls (or guys) from the Old Country with too much facial hair and a tendency to start crying at any mention of the Former Soviet Bloc, most people want to go eat hip food on first dates. Besides, this is heavy stuff, and it's hard to have first-date sex when you've eaten a big bowl of Metrosexual Ground Beef Stroganoff. (Why metrosexual? The red peppers and the garlic.)<br /><br />This is for once you've got them in your clutches. Make this for dinner, and you've got them.<br /><h2>Metrosexual Ground Beef Stroganoff</h2><br /><h3>Ingredients</h3><br /><ul><br /><li>2 lbs. lean ground beef (you can use stew meat as well, but you'll need to boil the hell out of it before you use it.)</li><br /><li>1 / 2 package wide egg noodles (or however much, you know how many noodles you like with your stroganoff)</li><br /><li>1 small container sour cream (about 1 1/2 to 2 cups)</li><br /><li>1 package white mushrooms</li><br /><li>1 cup roasted red peppers (like you buy in a jar, but freshly roasted also works)</li><br /><li>2 cloves garlic</li><br /><li>1/2 cup white onion</li><br /><li>2 tbsp. butter</li><br /><li>Salt</li><br /><li>Pepper</li><br /><li>Paprika</li><br /></ul><br /><h3>Directions</h3><br />Fill a pot with enough water to cover the noodles. Put it on the oven and turn it to high. When it starts boiling fast, reduce to medium high and put your noodles in it. It will cook while the sauce is cooking. If you don't know how to tell if noodles are cooked, or how to deal with them once they are cooked, I can't help you.<br /><br />Put your butter in a big nonstick saucepan on the stove (one size bigger than you think you should use, as we're gonna toss the noodles in there at the end) and set your heat to medium high. As it's melting, take your mushrooms, onion, garlic and red peppers and put them on a cutting board. Thin-slice the mushrooms and dice the rest. By the time you're done, the butter should be melted and slightly bubbling.<br /><br />Throw the mushrooms, onion, garlic and red peppers into the butter. Swirl them around with a wooden spoon, getting them all covered with melted butter. Sauté them like this until the mushroom are soft and the onions are mostly transparent. You'll notice that the juice from the red peppers turns everything kinda orange -- this is fine and in fact desirable.<br /><br />When the vegetable (and fungus) mix is sautéed, toss your meat in. Shake some salt and pepper (to taste) over it. Stir it and mash it up with your wooden spoon until it's all crumbled up and mixed up with the rest.<br /><br />Cover your saucepan and let this cook for about ten minutes, stirring it every so often. COVER YOUR PAN. When you cover it, the mixture doesn't dry out and in fact gets all juicy, which is what we want.<br /><br />Noodles are done. Drain 'em and leave 'em in the drainer for right now.<br /><br />If your meat is all browned, your sauce is done. Reduce the heat to full-stop medium and dump your sour cream in there. Mix it until there are no clumps of sour cream left and no un-sour-creamed bits of meat and vegetables. (And fungus.)<br /><br />Add a little more salt and pepper, again to taste, and a couple of dashes of paprika. Take your noodles and throw them into the saucepan. Mix until the noodles and the sauce are all over each other.<br /><br />Remove from heat and serve. Eat.<br /><br /><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 15-20 minutes<br /><br /><strong>Serves:</strong> 2-3, depending on who's got body issues at the table.<br /><br /><strong>Possible wines:</strong> What kind of pretentious twat drinks wine with friggin' beef stroganoff? Try iced tea, there, Ernest and Julio Gallo.<br /><br /><strong>Possible desserts: </strong>None, you fat bastard. Did you read my goddamn directions? <em>Two cups of sour cream</em>. You don't need dessert after this.<br /><br />But if you insist, maybe a cookie.</p>",

                "content": "<p>I'm not really much of a gamer. I was when I was a kid, back in the <a title=\"You have been eaten by a grue.\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infocom\">Stone Age</a>, and I've had my periods of obsessive game play as an adult, though it was more linked to specific games (<em>Half-Life, American McGee's Alice, GTA: Vice City, Tomb Raider</em>) than to a desire to game in general.<br /><br />Having said that...I really want to play <a href=\"http://www.spore.com/ftl\"><em>Spore</em></a>. It's got everything I love -- algorithmic generation, evolution, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life\">Conroy's game of Life</a>, interplanetary war, urban theory, fractal landscapes, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_Spore#Music\">music by Brian Eno</a>...hell, Will Wright might as well have designed this game to my own personal specs. I have a funny feeling I'll be spending far too much time in front of this game...particularly the Creature Editor, which looks like more fun than a barrel full of monkeys having fun.<br /><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/sporeeditor1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/sporeeditor1.jpg\" /></a></p><br /><br /><h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">Creature Editor</h5><br /><p style=\"text-align: left;\">I'm also fascinated by the online, multiplayer aspect of the game, in which people can allow others access to their creatures and worlds. It would be interesting if <em>Spore</em> has a plugin architecture, wherein Maxis could update/extend the interactivity between players. It would be interesting to embed the functionality of other sim games within it; imagine being able to play <em>The Sims</em> with your <em>Spore</em> characters, on your own planet. Or extend the city-building functionality to full-on <em>SimCity</em> level detail and control. After all, Spore seems like a palimpsest of all the other Wright-created sim games.</p><br /><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/spore_civphase1.jpg\" /></p><br /><br /><h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">Civilization Phase</h5><br /><em>Spore</em> comes out in September, but you can watch a guy messing with the beta of the Creature Editor live (I think) <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/channel/spore-live\">here</a>.<a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/channel/spore-live\"> </a></p>",

                "content": "<p>Here's something I wrote on <a href=\"http://www.freakangels.com/whitechapel\">Whitechapel</a>, Warren Ellis's message board, in the context of <a href=\"http://freakangels.com/whitechapel/comments.php?DiscussionID=2477\">a discussion</a> about the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity\">Singularity</a> that I started. I thought it would be worth posting here, as it explains some of my earlier thoughts.<br /><br />---<br /><br />My whole point with the <a href=\"http://jwz.livejournal.com/543348.html\">Grim Meathook Future</a> thing was that, despite what us nerds would like to believe, we're not really building revolutions. Open-source software is very cool, but if you want to see a <em>real</em> open-source revolution, look at Al-Qaeda and its various <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_distro\">distros</a>. A lot of these guys are educated in the West and just as familiar with <a href=\"http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/\">the cathedral and the bazaar</a> as any eager MIT comp-sci undergrad. And they're recruiting and educating and training people to go out and commit murder on an awesome scale...using frameworks and ideas designed to help nerds make better tools. Remember Gibson's dictum about how the street finds its own uses for things? That's what the street does with open-source.<br /><br />And they're winning. Not just Al-Qaeda, but crazy fucking imbeciles like George Bush and his posse of fuckheads, who probably genuinely believe that they're doing God's good work by slaughtering the ragheads. Russian gangsters using data havens to store the accounting data for their white slavery rings. Even -- as Bruce Sterling wrote about in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Tomorrow-Now-Envisioning-Fifty-Years/dp/0679463224\"><em>Tomorrow Now</em></a> -- Chechen rebels coordinating decentralized attacks against Russian tank columns using cell phones. You wanna see smart mobs? That's a fucking smart <em>mob</em>. One of the very first.<br /><br />Name me a single technology handed off to the world in the 21st century that's had as much global impact as a couple of rabid God-deluded cunts flinging planes into Manhattan. Seriously. I can't think of anything, and I've been trying for a really long time now.<br /><br />The cavemen are winning.<br /><br />In the wake of that, the Singularity is a sad little fantasy dancing around the heads of sad, detached little geeks. You're right: it's not the Nerd Rapture for nothing. It's the Rapture for people too stupid to give up their search for a messiah and too hip to go looking in churches or temples. It's a subculture of people who think Heaven looks like a video arcade with a never-ending supply of tokens, and they can go to Hell, the lot of them.<br /><br />But I do believe that, some time down the road, we will transcend the limits that physical evolution has embedded in us. I really do. I think that's the logical endgame of these big, magnificent brains that we have. Hell, we've been transcending nature since the first Cro-Magnon figured out how to take a chunk of flint and give himself a jaguar's claw, or when he struck that flint against a chunk of steel and gave himself the burning power of a lightning bolt, whenever he needed it. <em>We've always done this</em>. And someday, we'll transcend the idea that death is, if not inevitable, at least unexpected and unwelcome.<br /><br />I probably won't ever see that day. Long before then, I'll be dead of lung cancer or a heart attack or simple old age. And that breaks my heart, because I don't want to stop experiencing and thinking. I don't want to die. I want to spend the next hundred thousand years wandering around the Universe. I want to be there when and if they finally crack through the quantum foam and make a door to all the universes next door. If I die, I want to die with the Universe itself. I want to be the mortal enemy of entropy.<br /><br />And that, to me, is a far more interesting idea than lounging around in some virtual Purgatory, conjuring up masturbatory fantasies and waiting to die of boredom.<br /><br />But that's just me.</p>",

Maybe they'll even be touch / multitouch, with dual USB / VGA or DVI cables.<br /><br /><img title=\"showmate-on-portablelcd\" src=\"http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/showmate-on-portablelcd1.jpg\" /><br /><br />So if you've got a <a href=\"http://eeepc.asus.com/\">EEE</a> or similar device and you need some more screen real estate than the small built-in LCD provided, for Photoshop or movie-watching or what have you, you'll simply pull your external portable monitor out of your bag and plug it in.<br /><br />Why nobody does this already, I don't know.  Maybe they do. But I haven't seen one. (The thing in the picture -- which <a href=\"http://community.citrix.com/blogs/citrite/adamma/2008/04/04/Nirvana+Device+Search+%28Impatica+Showmate%29\">I found here</a> and can't seem to identify -- is some sort of industrial LCD, and not really what I have in mind.) And it's simple tech. And obviously it's doable from an industrial design perspective.<br /><br />So let's have it.<br /><br />[Edit: of course, I forgot about Wacom's <a href=\"http://www.wacom.com/cintiq/\">Cintiq</a>, which is one of the pieces of hardware I'd most like to own, but that's pretty high end. I was thinking of something much more aimed at a general market -- just a basic screen.]</p>",

But it's empty -- empty except for a small team of explorers, led by one Dr. River Song, who seems to know the Doctor...intimately.<br /><br />It was fun and heartbreaking and strange, and romantic and amazing.

The <a href=\"http://www.moogmusic.com/moogguitar/\">Moog Guitar</a> isn't a guitar synth -- which one would expect from the legendary synth manufacturer. Instead, it's some kinda weird variant on an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_guitar\">Infinite Guitar</a>, though it has more functionality. It can not only infinitely sustain tapped or plucked notes, but the opposite as well -- it can automatically mute notes. A third mode allows you to sustain only the notes you're playing at the moment.<br /><br />Really weird, but interesting. As a mediocre guitarist, this wouldn't ever be something I'd buy, even if I could afford it -- it'd be wasted on me. I'd get an Infinite Guitar instead.<br /><br />But for more talented players, I bet you could do some amazing shit with this.</p>",

                "content": "<p><em>Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story</em> had some funny moments, but on the whole, I thought it was trying way too hard. It couldn't decide if it wanted to be satire or parody, and consequently it fails on both fronts, I think, despite some great performances and some genuinely funny bits -- the Beatles bickering, the roadie's penis hanging out next to John C. Reilly's head, the bits with Tim Meadows as the drugged-out drummer trying to warn Dewey away from the various drugs he keeps finding Meadows doing in various bathrooms. (\"You don't want none of this, Dewey!\")<br /><br />So here's my impression of a style I think would have worked better for the film. Hollywood, feel free to call me the next time you want to do a rock biopic parody.<br /><div style=\"text-align: left; position: relative; font-family: Courier New,Courier;\">INT.

Then I read about <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080601/ap_on_re_af/uganda_children_on_the_rocks\">shit like this</a>, and I remember that nothing in my life will ever suck this bad.<br /><br /><blockquote>KAMPALA, Uganda - Stephen Batte works in a quarry under the blazing sun, chipping rocks into gravel with a homemade hammer. It's tiring, boring and dangerous.<br /><br />Stephen is 9 years old, and has been on the rock pile since he was 4.<br /><br />\"Life has always been hard here,\" he whispers, carefully positioning a sharp rock before striking it with well-practiced accuracy. \"But since my mother died, things have been much harder.\"<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />He remembers her when she was showing him, as a toddler, how to crush stones.<br /><br />\"I sat next to her and she showed me how to hold the hammer. It's not easy and at first I would hit my fingers so I cried a lot. It made my mum very sad but she said we had to earn money to buy food.\"<br /><br />Now he works alone at the quarry and spends his meager earnings on food. He sleeps in the crumbling mud hut he used to share with his parents and baby sister. He says his stepfather abandoned them after their mother's death. The sister, 8 months old, was put in an orphanage.<br /><br />\"If I stay in the house I feel lonely and I fear the memories,\" he explains. \"So even though I'm tired when I leave the quarry, I go and play football with my friends.\"<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />\"I wish I could be helped,\" he said, picking at a large scab on his knee, \"but I cannot see another life for me.\"</blockquote><br /><br />Whatever the worst shit you have to deal with in your life is, this kid would gladly trade you. Really.<br /><br />And will somebody just fucking kill <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Kony\">Joseph Kony</a>, please? Really? Can we just get somebody to take care of this, please? Killing people doesn't solve anything most of the time, but I think this might really be the exception.<br /><br />The Ugandans don't need relief aid -- they need somebody to come with a lot of guns and slaughter that evil, wretched motherfucker and his inner circle. Because for every kid who gets helped, he kidnaps and brainwashes ten more -- after he's killed their families, of course. And that's just the boys -- the girls he turns out to get sportfucked in the back of the camp eight times a day. That's until they're too AIDS-ridden or too broken to be used anymore. Then they get beaten to death. Which makes sense, right? Why waste a bullet on a thirteen year old whore with syphilis? Easier to bash their skulls in with a rock.<br /><br />How's about we get our boys and girls out of Iraq and send 'em to do something honorable and right for a change? Like killing this contemptible cocksucker (or bringing him to trial, as a distant second option) and helping the children he's turned into monsters and whores?<br /><br />Seems like a better goal than whatever the fuck it is we think we're accomplishing in Iraq -- bringing freedom to a bunch of people who seem less interested in Western democracy and more interested in actively hacking each other to death over the vastly important question of who got to be Head Mullah In Charge after Mohammed took the big walk. All in the name of an unwinnable war on terror, and does anybody even really believe that, still? Stupid people, I guess.<br /><br />You want to fight terror? Fight Stephen Batte's terror. That's a fight you can win. Help him get out of that rock pile. Help his brothers and countrymen to end this terror that's been going on since long before those fuckheads flew planes into the World Trade Center.<br /><br />Stop thinking about how much it costs to fill up your fucking car and how scared you were when you realized that bombs can go off on American soil as easily as anywhere else. Quit voting horrific men into positions of power. Quit making fun of Bono -- he may be an earnest goofball, but at least he's trying, and that's more than I can say for most people.<br /><br />Help Stephen Batte. Because he can't help himself. Because you can do it, by writing to your Congressperson and Senator. And because it's a good thing to do.</p>",

But it occurred to me that that title was too evocative not to use in a song.<br /><br />And so there will actually be a title track for the album, and it's half-written. It's a sort of dub track, minor key, extremely long (with one verse and chorus written, it currently stands at over five minutes, and it'll probably almost go twice that length). The lyrics (so far) are about...well, basically, about the Third World. It's dedicated to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fela_Kuti\">Fela Kuti</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Strummer\">Joe Strummer</a>.<br /><br />I'm gonna add guitar to it tonight -- right now it's just percussion, bass and synth washes, along with sort of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauntology\">hauntological</a> samples from <a href=\"http://freesound.iua.upf.edu/\">Freesound</a>.<br /><br />But even in its current form, I've been listening to it on repeat for the past few days, because I fucking love it. It's menacing and epic and it may end up being the best thing I've ever written.<br /><br />Current lyrics:<br /><br />Drink <a href=\"http://www.spiritsreview.com/reviews-whiskey-cobra.htm\">cobra whiskey</a> from a paper cup<br />There is no water -- it's all dried up<br />And when we speak<br />Our tongues stick to our teeth<br />They burn the bodies in a cardboard town<br />A hundred kilometers further down<br />The river<br />Another monument to grief<br /><br />La la la la la la sing the whores on the corner<br />La la la la la la sing the rude boys who are<br />Pissing in the gutter<br />And crying in their sleep<br /><br />Bang bang bang bang says the man with the big gun<br />Bang bang bang bang says the kid with the steel drum<br />Playing in the alleyway<br />And dying in the street<br /><br />We are ghosts in a burning city<br />Ghosts in a burning city<br />Burning, watch it burning<br />Watch it burn<br /><br />I'll post a sample (or the whole thing on muxtape) when it's closer to being finished.</p>",

                "content": "<p>Ben Rubenstein has written <a href=\"http://www.popmatters.com/pm/columns/article/58788/im-with-the-band/\">a great piece over at PopMatters</a> about the problem with being both a music critic and a friend of musicians. Call it the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_Famous\">Stillwater</a> Syndrome.<br /><br />This is always a problem -- as a critic, it's your job to be honest and uncompromising. As a human, it's your job to want your friends to succeed. And as a friend, it's not really cool to point out that something your friend has devoted their lives to is complete shit -- or even worse, dull.<br /><br />This is a problem I myself have faced. I'd consider myself at least on friendly acquaintance with Mark Stoermer of The Killers -- we're not bosom buddies, I've never been to his house, but we always chat whenever we run into one another, and I like the guy. I've also never really made much of a secret that I'm not a huge fan of The Killers. (Even though I cover \"All These Things That I've Done\" live, because I think it's a great song, and maybe someday I'll post a recording here.) I don't despise them, but I don't really think Brandon Flowers deserves the critical acclaim he gets as a songwriter. They're a good pop band, but that's about it, in my opinion. And that's the opinion of somebody who occasionally writes professionally about music, for whatever that may be worth.<br /><br />I've never really discussed it with Mark, because I'd consider it rude. And I'm certainly very happy for his success. Seeing him at Live 8, standing next to, like, fucking Roger Waters, was beautiful. He's a really nice guy and, I think, a good person, and an extremely talented guitarist and bassist. I always wish him well. (I'd like to see Mark fronting a band, myself.)<br /><br />But I would be a hypocrite if I pretended to like his band more than I do, just because I know him and think he's very talented. And I have a big problem with hypocrisy in myself. I fight to not be a hypocrite, as much as I can. I fail a lot, but I try. I do believe in tact, but I also only believe in being tactful to the point where you're still telling the truth.<br /><br />I fail at that, because I'm a coward and I want people I like to be happy. So there have been times that I've lied to musician friends. And I've felt bad about it, because I felt like I was betraying a principle I'd set for myself.<br /><br />When I put out my album, I'm going to hand it off to a few people who are both friends and music critics. And I'm going to ask them -- then and now -- to do something that, oftentimes, I haven't had the courage to do myself.<br /><br />I want them to be absolutely merciless. I want them to tell the truth. Because I believe that my music, as much as it means to me -- and as much as I want to be told that I'm a genius unparalleled in the history of rock -- is only part of a larger conversation that we're all having. Their job -- and mine, when I'm wearing that hat -- is to tell the truth. My job as a musician is to try to communicate. Sometimes those two objectives clash.<br /><br />And I won't hold it against them if they hate it. Really. But that's not me being really enlightened or anything.<br /><br />I won't hold it against them if they hate it because I'll know that they're mistaken. Because it's genius.<br /><br />Every last goddamn note.<br /><br />The spaces between songs? Genius. The way the CD smells? Genius. Pure, unadulterated human glory, wrapped up in a package of sweet, sweet musique.<br /><br />So, you know, <em>that's</em> okay.</p>",

            "source": {
                "content": "<p>Tomorrow is Memorial Day, when we Americans give our remembrance of those Americans who've died fighting for this country. (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_casualties_of_war\">Estimates of the numbers</a> vary <a href=\"http://www.historyguy.com/american_war_casualties.html\">wildly</a>, but let's say about 1.8 million Americans total since the War of Independence.) In point of fact, most Americans mark Memorial Day as the psychological beginning of summer.<br /><br />Personally, I think Memorial Day ought to be not an American but a worldwide holiday: a day when all of us, in every country, mourn and remember those who died fighting for us -- those whom history has painted as heroes, those whom history has painted as monsters, and those whose names and deeds were never even recorded for posterity. It should be a day when we recognize and acknowledge the human cost of our disagreements and arguments, going all the way back to the mythological figure of Abel, lying dead in a field somewhere with his brains bashed in over his brother's jealousy of God's love. (Of course, many scholars see the story of Cain and Abel as an allegory for the triumph of cultivators over pastoral nomads...but that would be appropriate as well: the masquerading of temporal, cultural and social conflict beneath the mask of religion.)<br /><br />It is very easy to forget that most of the soldiers who ever breathed their last on a battlefield or in a military hospital bed were unwilling or barely willing conscripts: boys, mostly, not really men, scared and confused and trying to simply survive the ordeal of doing what they were told. Most of them didn't want war. They wanted families, businesses, homes; they wanted to grow old with their grandchildren on their knees. And this is as true of every German soldier who died at Normandy and St. Petersburg as it is of the American and British and Russian soldiers who killed them, and died in turn at their hands.<br /><br />Some of them saw horrible things, and most of them did horrible things, and there is no excuse for those things; but those are things we deal with on every other day of the year. Tomorrow, we ought to remember what they gave, not what they took.<br /><br />This is an especially sad Memorial Day for Americans. In the Iraq War, America has lost over 4,000 soldiers. Almost 30,000 have been wounded. Civilian casualties -- dead and wounded -- may run as high as 650,000 or even a million. It's a stupid, dishonorable war architected by stupid, dishonorable men on every side of the conflict -- American, Iraqi and insurgent alike. But that does not lessen the sacrifice of those who are dying -- dying to defend their own country, dying to defend the idea of democracy, dying for their faith. I abhor their ideals and I am heartbroken at the idea that anyone would willingly end their life to defend any religious system, Christian or otherwise. But I will not take their deaths lightly simply because I disagree with their reasons for dying.<br /><br />War is never the right answer, but sometimes it's the only answer. Until we learn to eradicate those things in the human brain which cause us to attack and hurt and steal from our fellow men, war will continue. Those young men and women will keep falling, whether in the sandy streets of Baghdad or the wastelands of Darfur or the killing fields of Myanmar.<br /><br />And we ought to all of us take tomorrow to think about that, and to decide what ideas can possibly be worth dying for.</p>",

They said they can't explain how she is alive.<br /><br />They said Thomas suffered two heart attacks and had no brain waves for more than 17 hours. At about 1:30 a.m. Saturday, her heart stopped and she had no pulse. A respiratory machine kept her breathing and rigor mortis had set in, doctors said.<br /><br />\"Her skin had already started to harden and her fingers curled. Death had set in,\" said son Jim Thomas.</blockquote><br /><br />If this is true, it's very exciting. Rigor mortis and decay have always been the only two ways to conclusively determine if a person is dead or not. But if a person can survive past rigor mortis, that suggests that \"death\" is not as binary as we may have thought.</p>",

That's what it comes down to. Just that sentence.<br /><br />See, imagine that friend of yours who's into, I dunno, classic cars. He's actually kinda an authority on the subject. And he knows really interesting stuff about classic cars, the kind of cool facts you actually are interested in hearing, every so often when you hang out at the bar or meet by chance at the coffeeshop. That's his thing, and it's cool, and even though sometimes he babbles on about Hearst shifters or whatever fucking Springsteen thing, he's still interesting and fun to talk to, mostly.<br /><br />Now imagine if every day, that guy showed up at your door with a detailed list of every interesting thing he found out in the last 24 hours about classic cars. Not just the big stuff, but little stuff -- a list of every shape of side mirror that Ford made between 1947-1979, for example. Also tangential stuff -- pictures of cars, songs about cars, ashtrays shaped like cars. Hell, one day he shows up with a list of the kind of car driven by every American presidential candidate since Herbert Hoover.<br /><br />That's when you start realizing that this guy is a pedantic, creepy obsessive freak who's not really interested in cars. He's interested in information <i>about</i> cars. And any interest you might have had in this hobby of his has been completely obliterated by the sheer volume of information he's flinging at you.<br /><br />And yes, you can simply tell him to fuck off and go away. But then, after a while, you find yourself missing that random, occasional bit of cool trivia he throws your way. So you let him back into your life, and simply resign yourself to listening to about five percent of anything he has to say.<br /><br />Now multiply this dude by a factor of a couple of billion, and you've got the blogosphere.<br /><br />Look, I really like the idea that anybody can share their thing -- whatever that thing may be -- with the world. But what I've learned in the decade or so since blogging really began is that a) I don't really care about 90% of the shit that other people care about, and b) I don't really care that much about half of the 10% that I do care about.<br /><br />I dig the steampunk aesthetic. I really do. I think steampunk computer mods are cool. Hell, I was into Thomas Dolby in the mid 1990s, when he was still uncool. But I don't need to know about every fucking garage machinist's attempt to retrofit a Turbo Grafix-16 into a goddamned Difference Engine. I don't want to see your crocheted steampunk-goggle cozy. I don't need to read steampunk slash fiction where Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla settle their battle over AC vs. DC with a vigorous round of man-on-man love in the snow outside Tesla's Colorado laboratory.<br /><br />I just don't care that much. Nor do I care about papercraft versions of classic synths, even though I love synthesizers. I don't want to read the Top Ten Humorous Blog Posts About Pixel Fonts, even though I dig pixel fonts a lot. Understand what I'm saying: I like and love these things, and I still really just don't wanna hear about every possible related thing you can think of to each and every subset and category of these things I like and love.<br /><br />I think I'm just getting completely fed up with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railfan#Trainspotting\">trainspotting</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otaku\">otaku</a> nature of the blogosphere. Sometimes popping open Google Reader in the morning is like wading into a giant room filled with Rain Men, only they're babbling about copyfighting and Rickrolling instead of batting averages, and counting casemods instead of toothpicks.<br /><br />And, of course, linking to each others' posts about copyfighting and Rickrolling and <i>Halo</i> casemods and The Funniest Single Words That John Hughes Characters Said In His 1980s Movies. (Hint: \"Donger\" is on the top of the list.)<br /><br />People like to snicker that the Internet generation has a massive collective case of ADD, but I think the opposite is true in many cases: a lot of the bloggers I know have attention <i>surfeit</i> disorder.<br /><br />Now, there's an obvious answer here: <em>gee, Ellis, you misanthropic asshole, if you don't like what people write, turn off your Internet and go fuck off back to a cabin in Montana or something.</em> And believe me, the temptation often looms. If it wasn't for iPods, I'd probably be the goddamn Unabomber's Apprentice.<br /><br />But I can't help feeling like I'm not the only one who feels this way, and I can't just write this off to me being a prick, as I can so many other things.<br /><br />I had an interesting idea during my rant to Gary: write an RSS reader that only pulls random posts from your list of regular blogs. It never shows you two consecutive posts from the same blog twice. It never shows you links from all your blogs simultaneously. It scans through posts for identical links, measures the length of each post with that link, and only shows you the longest one. It can filter out certain words. (In my case, it would begin with a list that was something like [\"American Idol\" \"copyfight\" \"lolcatz\" \"halo\" \"lohan\" \"papercraft\" \"knitted\" \"casemod\" \"Ruby on Rails\" \"anything about how hard it is to find good Vietnamese food in goddamn Manhattan\"] and was added to constantly.)<br /><br />I like that idea. Ambiguity. Because ambiguity is far more interesting than the alternative, which seems to be what we're all so desperately shooting for here on the Web.<br /><br />And now I'm going to sleep.</p>",

And indeed, I wasn't disappointed: judging by the first episode, this looks pretty interesting.<br /><br />The short version: a Manchester cop named Sam Tyler is tracking a serial killer. Unfortunately, his girlfriend (and fellow police officer) is captured by the killer, who strangles his victims a day after kidnapping them. Driving away from the scene, Sam begins to cry. He pulls over to the side of the road and gets out of his car...and is promptly hit at high speed by another passing vehicle.<br /><br />He wakes up...only the freeway overpass he was under is gone. The road he was on is gone. He's wearing a tight leather jacket and a shirt with a butterfly collar, tight bell-bottoms and some sort of ridiculous boots.<br /><br />Oh, and it's 1973.<br /><br />He's still a cop, and when he turns up at his station -- only to discover it full of chain-smoking men with terrible haircuts who look like <i>Monty Python</i> extras -- he also finds that his serial killer -- the one he's pursuing in 2006 -- has killed a woman in 1973. So can he stop this guy, using the relatively primitive criminology of the time...and keep the killer from murdering his girlfriend, thirty years later?<br /><br />Good stuff. Sam Tyler is played by John Simm, who did an absolutely kick-ass turn as the Master in last season's finale of <i>Doctor Who</i>. All in all, this looks pretty promising.<br /><br />Apparently this is being made into an American series as well, though I'd rather see this version out before checking out the American one. And there's also a sequel series, called <i>Ashes To Ashes</i>, that's running now on the BBC.</p>",

You don't want the details.<br /><br />So I'm sitting in this darkened, empty apartment listening to The Cure's <i>Pornography</i> and trying to steel myself to go get some sort of foodstuffs to complement Andie's extensive collection of pastas and grains. It was 100º today, and I ventured out early in the afternoon to get Gatorade (to replace my electrolytes. <a href=\"http://www.soundpolitics.com/archives/010656.html\">Electrolytes are what plants crave</a>.) and I thought I was gonna pass out on the broiling pavement and die.<br /><br />I feel weak and generally shitty (no pun intended) and my brain seems to be running on impulse power and it's finally cool enough that I'm maybe willing to venture outside. It's only about 75º now.<br /><br />But I like sitting here, with this gloomy, spacy music playing.

Unfortunately, I don't have the money to buy this stuff, and I think a lot of it might take some effort to track down.<br /><br />So does anybody have any of the following: Blind Lemon Jefferson, Louie Armstrong And His Hot Five (or Hot Seven), Leadbelly? Or Texas swing of the 1920s? Or really any popular music of the time?<br /><br />Or links to where I can download this stuff? Streaming is okay, but I prefer download, so I can listen to it when I'm not Net connected.<br /><br />Thanks!</p>",

I feel so fucking stupid -- I've flown literally fifty times or more in my life, and I've never missed a flight before, <i>ever</i>. I simply misread my itinerary -- I was flying from Vegas to Chicago to Delhi, and I read the departure time from Chicago as the departure time from Vegas.<br /><br />In my own defense, I was completely deranged from sleeplessness and stress -- finishing a web project (see below), sorting out a couple of other projects (also see below), packing, sorting everything out...I got a total of ten hours of sleep in the three days before I was supposed to leave. I'm lucky I was able to read it at all.<br /><br />And, honestly...this is going to sound odd, but I just had a sort of bad feeling about the trip. It wasn't very well organized and...I dunno, I just felt apprehensive. I don't know why, but I felt like something bad was going to happen.<br /><br />I don't get those sorts of feelings often, but when I do, I'm usually right. I'm not claiming psychic abilities or anything silly like that...but I <i>am</i> right, more often than not.<br /><br />I still feel dumb, though.<br /><br />So I'm going to record my vocals instead, for the album, now. Which means it's almost done. And I've got some more info about that blogging thing I mentioned recently, which I should announce soon -- probably tomorrow.<br /><br />Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.vorteximmersion.com/\">take a look at the Flash header I just designed for Vortex Immersion</a>. I'm rather proud of it -- it's all done in Actionscript 3.0 programmatically, no pre-created movie clips or anything. It loads content dynamically, so the guys at Vortex can just add new video and clips at their leisure.<br /><br />I hope to be working with these guys more in the near future on other cool projects. And I've got another thing coming up which I hope will come together.<br /><br />Lots of work, but no money. I can't afford to pay my phone bill, for reasons I don't want to get into here, so it will remain off for the time being. (Anybody need a couple hundred bucks worth of web/print design? I work quickly and I work well.)<br /><br />I'm really stressed, but hopeful about these new projects.<br /><br />And now to haul out my recording gear and try to get at least one song tracked tonight. I think I'm going to try and do \"Berlin Floor Show\" and \"Scarecrow\", since they're the ones I've got melodies and harmonies actually sorted out on.</p>",

Other than that, clothes-wise, I'm taking basic jeans, a bunch of sleeveless t-shirts and a few light cotton overshirts, and a sport coat just in case.<br /><br />Electronics are the usual: laptop, iPod, still and DV cameras, phone. I may actually take a microphone and my old FireWire 410 audio interface to do some field recording of jungle sounds and shit -- I'm guessing, based on the pictures I've seen, that Chandigarh is in the jungle -- but other than that, I'm keeping it hella light.<br /><br />But I've never been to India, so if you have any recommendations for stuff you think I ought to take, put 'em in the comments.

The key thing in any company is morale. He says that if you have low morale, you're getting $0.25 of value for every $1 you're spending. If morale is high, you're getting $3 for every $1.<br /><br />I can't understand why more people running businesses can't figure this out. As an employee, I don't owe you a fucking thing except the amount of work I'm willing to put in for what you're paying me. If you abuse me or treat me like I'm replaceable, one of two things will happen: I'll either walk, or if I need the money, I'll do the minimum amount of work to float along and get my paycheck...and as soon as I can find something better, I'll walk anyway.<br /><br />At the ripe old age of 30, I've decided that I'm never again going to put up with shitty behavior from employers. I expect to be treated with respect, as a valued member of a team, and I will <i>not</i> be treated like a goddamn Victorian factory worker. Even with a recession on, I've got enough highly desirable skills that finding a decent job will probably never be a problem for me. (Particularly since I have such a cross-disciplinary skillset.)<br /><br />So why should I put up with some supervisor who's decided that his/her job is to keep an iron grip on me and my colleagues? I'd rather work for someone who treats me like a human, who actually wants to make sure I'm happy and satisfied with what I'm doing, who lets me be an individual rather than trying to fit me into some corporate idea of what a good worker will be.<br /><br />You do that, man, and I'll work my guts out for you. I'll work extra hours. I'll go that extra mile. And I think that's true of anyone.</p>",

Ruth of the U.S. Army 101st Airborne Division, is a bad motherfucker.<blockquote>“Please forward this to the proper channels. I have read Stephen Hawking’s latest remarks on space travel and the importance of it to human survival. The problem is, NASA is going about it all the wrong way.<br /><br />Here is an idea: Send battle-hardened, strong-minded soldiers and marines on the long trips into space. We are conditioned to live with the bare minimal (of) life’s necessities and are trained to be prepared for … the worst conditions that any environment could throw at us.<br /><br />Hell, me and my men will go, set up a colony somewhere and await colonists to arrive.<br /><br />Me and most of my men are on our 3rd or 4th deployment into a combat area. We are scouts, reconnaissance specialists. We go before everyone else and spend time living off the land. Sounds just like the type of men needed for a long colonization journey.<br /><br />Please pass this message on to anyone you know in the space program. (T)here are many men already trained and prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for their country and the human race.<br /><br />Thank you for you time.<br /><br />SFC Ruth, 101st Airborne Division. Afghanistan”</blockquote><br /><br />Good luck with that, buddy. And remember the first rule of space soldiering: when in doubt, <a href=\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aliens#Ripley\">nuke the site from orbit. It's the only way to be sure.</a></p>",

            "source": {
                "content": "<p>I got a call from <i>Las Vegas CityLife</i> editor Steve Sebelius today.<br /><br />\"I've got some not-so-great news,\" he said.<br /><br />I started writing a column for the <i>CityLife</i> back in, oh, late 2000 or early 2001. Originally called \"Cyber Spyder\", it was a sort of basic technology column. I did so at the request of then-editor Matt O'Brien, who had seen me rant at poetry readings at Cafe Roma, but wasn't (I think) aware that I was already a professional journalist, of sorts.<br /><br />When I was living in Seattle in 2001, I was wooed away from the <i>CityLife</i> by the <i>Las Vegas Mercury</i>, mainly by the method of offering me more money. My column for them -- another tech-oriented column -- was called \"Paranoid Android\", because editors Andrew Kiraly and Geoff Schumacher didn't like my original title, \"All Tomorrow's Parties\".<br /><br />I enjoyed writing the column, but over time I realized I was tired of just writing about technology. I wanted to expand the column -- something which the powers-that-be at the <i>Mercury</i> were unwilling to do. So I talked to Matt O'Brien, and I returned to the <i>CityLife</i> in the winter of 2001. My new column was called, as I'd wanted my <i>Mercury</i> column to be, \"All Tomorrow's Parties\". (For those of you who are unaware, \"All Tomorrow's Parties\" is the name of one of my favorite Velvet Underground songs, as well as a book by one of my favorite authors, William Gibson.)<br /><br />Originally, the column was supposed to be generally technology and futurism-oriented, but that soon went out the window. I wrote whatever the hell I wanted. To the credit of the various people who oversaw my column over the years -- Matt O'Brien first and foremost amongst them\" -- I was rarely edited for content, though Matt would occasionally remove an extraneous \"fuck\" or \"cocksucker\" from each week's installment.<br /><br />I got fan mail. I got hate mail. In those early days, right after 9/11, someone once sent me an envelope full of white powder. (I almost snorted it.) I got endless mail from people telling me I was going to burn in hell, which I loved to read aloud.<br /><br />I wrote a few cover stories for the paper. Two of them -- a two-part series that Matt and I wrote about the homeless people living under the city -- got national attention. We were nominated for a Pulitzer -- by our own company, admittedly, that's how Pulitzer nominations work -- but still, it was pretty cool. (Matt has, of course, <a href=\"http://www.beneaththeneon.com/\">expanded those stories into a book</a>, which by all accounts is doing pretty well. I went off to found an online music store instead of writing it with him.)<br /><br />One July, some lunatic began calling my house and leaving messages that he thought we lived in the Matrix, that I was his guru, and that he was going to see if my powers were real by seeing if I could dodge bullets. The calls came from a downtown motel. I bought an air pistol, in the theory that if he came to my door, I could shoot him in the face with it and then lock the door and call the cops.<br /><br />People recognized me -- in restaurants, in clubs, at the corner grocery store in the middle of the night. I was a minor Vegas celebrity, not quite on par with that Australian guy who does the goofy car commercials, but close.<br /><br />I won Nevada Press Association awards -- a few of them. Some of my pieces got syndicated nationally and internationally.<br /><br />Then Stephens Media (owners of the <i>Las Vegas Review-Journal</i>) bought the <i>CityLife</i>, folded the <i>Mercury</i> and brought their staff in to run things. They decided my column should run monthly rather than weekly, in rotation with a group of other \"Slant\" columnists. I've been told by several hundred people that it was this decision -- as well as the decision to fire columnist Saab Lofton -- that led them to put the <i>CityLife</i> down and never pick it up again.<br /><br />But people still came up to me and told me how much they loved the column, how I had gotten them to think about things in a new way, how sometimes I'd given them comfort and made them feel not so alone.<br /><br />And along the way, I wrote some of the finest things I've ever written -- the column entitled <a href=\"http://www.lvcitylife.com/articles/2002/08/15/export1369.txt\">\"Meteors In A City Sky\"</a>, dated August 15th, 2002, for example, or the column <a href=\"http://www.lvcitylife.com/articles/2003/02/05/export185.txt\">\"I Grieve\"</a>, about the Columbia tragedy, from February 2003. I talked about politics and the horror of the Bush administration -- and, if I do say so myself, predicted a lot of the turns of political fortune that happened in the last eight years -- and nanotechnology and transhumanism and reality television and rock and roll and a lot of other things. I pissed all over Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman, which I did and still do take great delight in. I angered people. I amused people.<br /><br />And maybe I did some good. God, I hope I did some good.<br /><br />And now it's done. My column this past week was the last -- fittingly, it was a story about transhumanism in the guise of Thomas Beattie, the man who's having a baby. Back to my roots a bit. There will be no swan song for \"All Tomorrow's Parties\".<br /><br />And I'm sad about that, because it has become so much of who I am. No matter what other shit I've done with myself since the planes hit the World Trade Center, I was always \"Joshua Ellis, <i>CityLife</i> columnist\".<br /><br />But all things do and must come to an end, and I'm happy that I had the run I did. I'm pretty sure that I'm the longest running columnist <i>CityLife</i> has ever had. The last seven -- make it eight, with the original column -- years have been a hell of a ride.<br /><br />Since I cannot do it in the paper, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all of you who read my columns over the years -- those of you who loved it, who hated it, who came up to me at the coffeeshop or in the street or in a bar to talk to me about it, who wrote me letters telling me to keep it up, to fight the good fight. Thank you for reading. More importantly, thank you for giving me the chance to make you think about things, even if you disagreed with me, because at least I got you thinking. And that's what I always wanted to do. Thank you for those endless, sacred days you gave me, as the Kinks once said.<br /><br />I'll still be here, of course, and I may soon show up in a couple of other places. I'm not done yet. Not by a long shot.<br /><br />Turn it up. Bring the noise.</p>",

            "name": "Reasons Why The Violent Femmes Are Not As Revered As The Pixies, And Some Reasons Why They Ought To Be; A Life Memoir",
            "source": {
                "content": "<p><h2>Part The First</h2><br /><ul><br /><li><strong>The Femmes were not a coastal band.</strong> I've always thought of the Violent Femmes as being a Midwestern band, and all of the evidence I've seen over the past twenty years suggests this is true. People out here on the West Coast like the Femmes, but they don't have that obsessive <i>love</i> that we had in places like Texas and Montana, and that I see in my friends from Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, etc. etc.<br /><br />I also think that the Femmes sound better in the Midwest. They sound awesome in LA or SF or Seattle or Vegas, as I can attest...but there's something about Gordon Gano's voice that resonates when it echoes against cornfields or amber waves of grain or the gray water of the Great Lakes.<br /><br />The same is not true of The Pixies. The Pixies, perhaps, are more universal -- \"Wave Of Mutilation (UK Surf Mix)\" is fucking <i>awesome</i> when you're driving down PCH from LA into Orange County, even though The Pixies were originally a Boston band.<br /><br />But as in all things, it's the coasts that matter when it comes to the psychogeography of indie rock. That's where most of the people who write about rock and roll live, and it's certainly where the vast majority of people who care about the mythology of a few relatively obscure underground rock bands tend to live. So maybe that's part of it.</li><br /><br /><br /><li><strong>People in the Femmes' songs aren't cool.</strong> They're not. They're sexually frustrated, creepy, paranoid, nervous, kinda retarded, occasionally homicidal. They're pale and skinny, and not in that way that gets the H&M girls wet. They smoke too much. They wear ugly clothing. They're full of loathing and self-loathing and obsession.</li><li><strong>The Femmes weren't cool.</strong> Gordon Gano's a goofy-looking little Jesus freak. Collectively, in fact, the Femmes look more like a team of Wisconsin road-clearers than they do a rock band. They played acoustic guitars. They sang songs with titles like \"American Music\" and \"Jesus Walking On The Water\". They were Rust Belt geeks.<br /><br />Now, this is a point of serious contention for me, because the Pixies weren't cool, either. Ever. Black Francis was a chubby nerd. Kim Deal is awesome, but she looks like a waffle waitress. They didn't do cool videos -- the video for \"Here Comes Your Man\" is funny, but it doesn't go anywhere.<br /><br />But both bands come from an ancient and bygone era when it was okay for underground rock bands to look like a bunch of plumbers on their weekend off rather than a) a pack of homosexual French bikers or b) a Burning Man camp. Neither the Femmes nor the Pixies made their career on clotheshorsing for the cover of <i>Spin</i>.<br /><br />(By the way, those sparks hitting you in the face? Totally coming off that axe I'm grinding. Sorry. But it damn well needs to be said.)</li><br /><br /><br /><li><strong>Nobody ever wore a Femmes shirt to prove they were cool.</strong> This is even true of Your Humble Narrator, who represents his indie cred with a <i>Trompe Le Monde</i> shirt but does not have, say, a <i>Hallowed Ground</i> shirt. I am very sad about this.<br /><br />But nobody ever needed to big-up the Femmes, because you just know they're awesome. As one announcer once pointed out (captured forever on the band's <i>Add It Up</i> collection), you cannot fuck with the Violent Femmes.<br /><br />You cannot fuck with this band.</li></ul><br /><br /><h2>Part The Second</h2><br /><br />I don't know if this is still true, but I can tell you that the Violent Femmes were Our Secret when I was a teenager, a decade after that first album came out. They were one of the things you had to know about to be cool, like <i>Love And Rockets</i> (the comic, not the band) and 'zines and David Lynch movies and Douglas Adams. You listened to the Femmes and you dropped acid and you talked a bunch of shit about the nature of reality and had trip sex with your female friends that usually didn't go anywhere, afterwards. You would sit and shriek \"Ten, ten, ten, ten for <i>everything everything everything everything!</i>\" and air-guitar Brian Ritchie's badass bass walk. (And Brian Ritchie is still one of the best rock and roll bass players, like, ever.)<br /><br />One of the saddest things about the Internet era is that it provides us with instant access to information. This has, in some sense, limited the ability of disaffected teenagers in culturally arid places to form taste tribes around hoarded bits of shared culture. I don't know if that moment still happens when the kid takes the dubbed copy of <i>The Velvet Underground And Nico</i> or <i>Bossanova</i> into her room, shuts the door, turns off the lights, lights up a clove cigarette, and has her mind blown forever. Now it's just MP3s. I am a digital music guy and I'm the last one to bemoan the instant availability of almost the entire recorded musical output of humanity...but when one door opens, another one closes. Maybe they just have MySpace groups now, I don't know.<br /><br />But I still remember when Jeremy Snyder first put <i>Violent Femmes</i> in the tape deck of his shitty sky-blue European station wagon and played \"Kiss Off\" for me. I remember feeling like it was part of some world I never knew existed. I remember it sinking into my DNA and twisting it forever. I remember Gordon Gano singing \"Why can't I get just one screw / Believe me, I know what to do / But somethin' won't let me make love to you\" and feeling it completely, all that lust and desperation. I had the Pixies, Concrete Blonde, Jane's Addiction, Nine Inch Nails, and, yes, Nirvana. (I remember smashing up my bedroom once to \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", in some adolescent rage thing.) I had Oingo Boingo and the Screaming Trees and the <i>Pump Up The Volume</i> soundtrack and the Lemonheads' <i>It's A Shame About Ray</i> and They Might Be Giants' <i>Flood</i>. These were the birdhouses in my soul.<br /><br />And I was desperately uncool. I wasn't the rad indie rock kid. I wasn't a beautiful loser. I was just a loser. I dressed poorly and I was awkward and acted weird and felt uncomfortable and horny and scared all the time -- scared of the kids who beat the shit out of me, scared that I was really genuinely crazy, scared that I was never gonna get out of these horrible little towns where I found myself, places where the highlight of Friday night was hanging out at the Town Pump gas station and trying to get someone to buy us Schlitz, and maybe get some stoner chick to let me touch her tits.<br /><br />And I'd go home and sneak in and go into my little bedroom and put on the Femmes and it was okay, because I wasn't alone. There was some other twisted weirdo nerd out there, singing songs to me. And I was cooler than the jock assholes and the rednecks, because they just liked whatever stupid shitty music was on the radio, and I had this secret thing, me and my uncool friends. They didn't have Violent Femmes albums at Wal-Mart. They weren't on MTV (except on <i>120 Minutes</i>, another secret lifeline). You couldn't find out about them on Wikipedia. You just heard things, or read them in 'zines. (Gordan Gano was this crazy gay dude who was also a teenage preacher. Every one of the Cure's albums was about a different drug, and you could figure it out by looking at the liner notes and decoding the hidden messages. Juliana Hatfield was Evan Dando's girlfriend, but she was still a virgin. They totally didn't do it, because he loved her <i>that much</i>.)<br /><br />And what significance does all of this have, in retrospect? Very little. No more than whether Carlos D has herpes, or whether Jenny Lewis really has gone out with every single dude whose band is signed to Saddle Creek Records, or whether the frontman for Red State Soundsystem really is a tantric sex god disguised as a sort of low-rent douchebag nerd Buddha. (Two of these, I know for a fact, are absolutely true.) It's all just pop culture, ephemeral as dew on early morning grass. It keeps rolling. Every day, new mysteries, new obsessions, and new people to have them.<br /><br />But it was part of my cultural mythology, part of what kept the boredom at bay, like believing that Brandon Lee was killed by Triad assassins or watching <i>Blade Runner</i> and <i>Aliens</i> with my friends on weekends and reading Umberto Eco and Jack Kerouac and sitting in diners all night long, chain-smoking and drinking fifty cent coffee with two creams and eight sugars until the waitress made us order something. (Cheese fries with a side of ranch, generally.) It kept me from killing myself because I couldn't see any options, like my friend Sarah Harms.<br /><br />So in that sense, the Violent Femmes saved my life, and maybe that's worth something to you, worth enough to go pick up that first album and go sit in your bedroom in the dark and put it on and try to remember when every day might be your last, and how it didn't fucking matter, because you were never going to die.<br /><br />The clove cigarettes are optional, but recommended.</p>",

It's about a guy named Zia (Patrick Fugit) who commits suicide because his girlfriend left him. He finds himself in a sort of Purgatory, a broke-down, trashy afterlife for suicides. He makes friends with Eugene (Shea Whigham), a Russian singer who committed suicide on stage, and gets a job working in a pizza joint. (Eugene bears more than a passing resemblance to Eugene Hutz, lead singer of Gogol Bordello, who is a friend of the director.)<br /><br />One day, Zia discovers that his ex-girlfriend has also committed suicide. He and Eugene hit the road, looking for her. Along the way, they meet Mikal (Shannyn Sossamon, whom I have an <i>enormous</i> crush on). She's trying to find the People In Charge, since -- as she keeps insisting -- she's not supposed to be here.<br /><br />It's about death and love and friends, and it's got Tom Waits in it, and it's really funny and really sweet, and I love it. You should check it out on DVD. I give it four and a half out of five.</p>",

Every so often, I just pull one out and shape it roughly into a song. I think of these pieces as sort of the musical equivalent of deleted scenes on a DVD, or b-sides. They're fun to put together and they sound nice, but they're not really full-fledged songs in their own right -- more musical textures, like motifs from a soundtrack. At some point, I'll probably put out a collection of them -- my own <i>Selected Ambient Works</i>, I suppose.</p>",

It's the first real piece of fiction I've finished in a long time. It's an 8-pager, a short story we're submitting to an anthology of Cthulhu stories, but I like it.<br /><br />It's called \"Spindletop\", it takes place in the mid-1920s, and it's about WWI, the oil boom in Texas, vengeance and Elder Gods. It opens with a paraphrased quote from Tom Waits and it ends with Yeats:<br /><br /><em>He had done most bitter wrong<br />To some who are near my heart,<br />Yet I number him in the song;<br />He, too, has resiged his part<br />In the casual comedy;<br />He, too, has been changed in his turn,<br />Transformed utterly:<br />A terrible beauty is born.</em><br /><br />And there are at least two jokes about milkshakes in it. And a mummified man with a party hat to cover the gunshot wound in his head. Fun stuff.<br /><br />The supporting characters are two Texas Rangers who belong to a very special branch of the outfit. They are the main characters in a mini series (and, hopefully, continuing series) that Wagner and I are developing.<br /><br />I don't know if it'll get approved for the anthology we're sending it to; if not, I'll post the final draft here so you can see it, at least.</p>",

I love electronic music, but I've been deeply dissatisfied with the way the songs have been coming out. They're just too cold and mechanistic, you know?<br /><br />So I've decided to re-record the album again. This time, though, it's all going to be acoustic instruments -- specifically, the sort of instruments used in Appalachian folk music. Steel guitars, fiddles, washboards...I've even found plans on the Net to build my own washtub bass. All the songs will be the same, but the arrangements and feel will be totally different.<br /><br />Because of this, the title I was using -- <i>Travelogues</i> -- is no longer appropriate, as the album no longer will really contain the elements of world and other non-American sounds I've been working with.<br /><br />Instead, the new title will be <i>The Red State Soundsystem Jug Band And Tent Chautaqua Presents: The Many Moods Of Big Josh Ellis</i>. The cover will be an <i>homage</i> to the classic art of the album <i>He Thinks He's Ray Stevens</i>, by Ray Stevens:<br /><br /><img src='http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/248031.jpg' alt='24803.jpg' /><br /><br />In fact, I've also made a short music video of the new version of \"Berlin Floor Show\", which you can watch below.<br /><br />I hope all of you will stick with me through this musical transition.<br /><br /><object  ><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/6jaWPQ3Z7FE&rel=0&hl=en\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/6jaWPQ3Z7FE&rel=0&hl=en\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" wmode=\"transparent\"  ></embed></object></p>",

            "source": {
                "content": "<p><i>GQ</i> has a story about the <a href=\"http://men.style.com/gq/features/full?id=content_6696&pageNum=1\">16 things to remember if you want to date a supermodel</a>. (Found on Digg, which made me giggle. Lots of guys dating supermodels on Digg.)<br /><br />After reading through it, I thought I'd make my own list: things to remember if you're a supermodel who wants to date me.<br /><br />Pay attention, Adriana.<br /><br /><strong>1) Okay, you're hot. And?</strong><br />As William Gibson once pointed out, we live in an age of affordable beauty. (If you don't know who William Gibson is, at least in passing, we're already off to a bad start.) I recognize your superior genetics. Now, why don't we try <i>having a real conversation</i>? What was the last book you read? Favorite movie? Most embarrassing high school behavior?<br /><br />Being pretty is simply not enough. Be interesting.<br /><br /><strong>2) You want me to take you <i>where</i>?</strong><br />No. I am not going to fly you to Paris to show you I'm romantic. Sorry, kitten. I might write you a song, I might even buy you a puppy, but the only time you and I are flying to Paris is on our honeymoon.<br /><br />Your multiple appearances on the cover of <i>Vogue</i> didn't suddenly make me rich. Though they probably made <i>you</i> rich.<br /><br />Come to think of it, you're taking <i>my</i> ass to Paris.<br /><br />We can fly coach. I'm cool with that.<br /><br /><strong>3) You are probably much hotter in a t-shirt than in a Christian Dior dress.</strong><br />Most women are. (Especially if a t-shirt is <i>all</i> they're wearing.) If you're dating me, I'm more interested in who you are off the runway than on it. So be a normal girl. It's cool. I won't tell anybody you don't wake up in full makeup and hair.<br /><br /><strong>4) Flirting with Brad Pitt is <i>not</i> okay.</strong><br />(Though flirting with Angelina probably is, unless you do her, and I'm not around to at least watch. That's not cool <em>at all</em>.) Playing little games to judge my level of adoration is the best way to find your million-dollar ass waiting for a taxi out front.<br /><br />Have some manners.<br /><br /><strong>5) Speaking of doing Angelina, would it, like, kill you to at least ask her? She might be down with it.</strong><br />I mean, I know she's married to Brad and everything, but maybe they swing. I mean, fine, you can ask him too. But I'm not touching Pitt's dick. I'm really firm about that.<br /><br />Clooney, maybe. But not Pitt. Fuck that.<br /><br /><strong>6) And your other model friends? Tell me you don't think it would be hot to make out with that one chick, you know who I'm talking about, the one from the makeup ads, while I'm totally like giving it to you from behind, and then I can switch off and hit that for a while and you can rub scented oil on your boobs.</strong><br />I'm just sayin'.<br /><br /><strong>7) No, I'm not going to reinstall Windows for you.</strong><br />I know you keep saying how \"totally adorable\" it is that I'm a geek, but it's just not gonna happen. Look, do I ask you to, like, try on my clothes and run around my living room with your arm cocked to the side in that totally gay way? No? Then don't ask me to do my job for free. (Unless you can pull off the Angelina thing.)<br /><br /><strong>8) And would it kill you to read some <em>Achewood</em>?</strong><br />No, Ray Smuckles is <i>not</i> that little sissy from Naples with the mohawk that Elton's been bringing to all the best parties this season. Pay <i>attention</i>.<br /><br /><strong>9) Listen, I'm really serious about this whole sex-with-you-and-Angelina-at-the-same-time thing.</strong><br />I'm not saying I'll break up with you if that shit doesn't happen, but I won't be quite as adoring. I'm just letting you know now.<br /><br /><strong>10) I know you're probably really shy and just a small town girl, but if we don't do it by the third date, I'm kicking your ass to the curb.</strong><br />Sorry, baby, but that's the way we roll in Ellistown. And you better not just lie there and act like I should be grateful just to touch 'em. You better be like a fucking wild cheetah. You better be like that chick in the video for \"Rio\", when she was all, like, scratching Simon LeBon's face with her nails and shit, and you know he hit that after the cameras stopped rolling, and she was probably awesome.<br /><br />Come to think of it, can you ask the chick from the \"Rio\" video to come over and get her freak on? She might be better than Angelina.<br /><br />I'd totally fix your computer then. Seriously.</p>",

(The exception are \"athletic fit\" button-downs, which are too tight both across my stomach and my shoulders. I couldn't fit in them no matter how thin I got. I'm just built like a linebacker.)<br /><br />The pants I'm wearing right now quite literally won't stay up without notching my belt all the way to the last hole...and even then they're a bit loose. It's not a fashion issue or anything like that at all -- I <i>look</i> like I'm wearing oversized clothes. Many of my older shirts now hang down near my knees.<br /><br />I'm very happy about this.<br /><br />Also, Joe Hill's book <i>Heart Shaped Box</i> is really, really good. It reminds me of the bits I really liked about Poppy Z. Brite's early horror fiction, and not the bits I didn't. (The fact that he's Stephen King's son is totally irrelevant. He doesn't write like his father. He writes like himself.)<br /><br />That's all -- just popping in with some randomness.</p>",

I'm going to be collaborating with him on a track for their album.<br /><br />Carlos also laid down some really pretty ambient guitar for \"Scarecrow\", which I've remixed a bit -- new drums, a pretty Rhodes texture, slightly shorter breakdown. It's very Johnny Greenwood stuff -- volume pedals and delay.<br /><br />I'm trying to decide if I have the stamina tonight to break out my gear and do a final guitar part for \"Not In This World (Or The Next One)\". I'm gonna do it with a direct-input electric guitar so it has more of a sound like Jeff Buckley's stuff. I just don't have the engineer, microphones or acoustic space to really properly record an acoustic guitar for that track -- there's nothing else to it, no drums or other instruments to cover ambient noise, so the recording would have to be hyper-pristine, and I just can't do it in practice. I think it'll sound good this way, though. And it might have some piano on it.<br /><br />I'm ditching a track or two, so the album will be shorter than I'd thought -- maybe ten or eleven songs instead of thirteen or fourteen. That's okay. Brevity is the soul of...well, something or other. Plus that way I totally have B-sides to mess with.<br /><br />Also: some Hammond organ on \"Scatterlings + Refugees\". It needs it. The other version I put out has it, but it's going to be much lower-key this time. Just a texture.<br /><br />I think I'm almost ready to start doing vocal recordings. Ryan and Melissa Marth from the Big Friendly Corporation have agreed to do some backup for me, and there's a couple of other people I'm thinking of asking as well. So I'll have to do that around other peoples' schedules, which is okay -- it's worth it to have that fullness to it.<br /><br />Once that's done, it's final mixes and masters, and I'm done with the recording. Then all I have to do is design the liner notes. And set up distribution. And maybe find a label. And...well, all the other stuff. Sigh.<br /><br />I have a small secret about the way I'm going to distribute it. I'm not telling yet. It has something to do with the whole \"future of music\" thing. Don't worry, you'll definitely be able to score a copy.</p>",

We have to sort out visas first, but apparently that's not a big deal.<br /><br />Joe and I will fly into New Delhi, and from there we'll travel north to the city of Chandigarh, which was partially designed by Le Corbusier! I thought it would be cold, but apparently it's going to be hot and humid, which I'm quite happy to deal with, and it makes packing a lot easier -- instead of carrying a big heavy leather jacket and sweaters, I can get away with light t-shirts, cargo pants and my usual combat boots/sandals combo (aside from a business-casual outfit or two). I don't know if spring is the rainy season or not, so I'm unsure if I really need to take a jacket at all. And my superpower is that I'm relatively immune to all but the most extreme weather and climatic shifts. Also, I don't get sick traveling ever, which is nice.<br /><br />I guess we'll be spending part of the time doing business stuff I can't really talk about here, but my impression is that we'll also have some time to do some exploring. We met with the guy we're working with over there -- he was in Vegas for a Microsoft conference -- and he agreed to take me up into the Himalayas.<br /><br />I've been wanting to go to India ever since I first read <i>The Razor's Edge</i> in my late teens, and I'm so excited I can barely stand it. Even though Chandigarh is apparently considered the most \"modern\" city in India, with the highest standard of living, I'm still hoping to try and get out of town and into the rural areas. Every city is beautiful in its own way, and worth seeing...but man, I'd like to get out into the forests.<br /><br />And I know it's stupid, but I can't help it: visions of <i>Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom</i> keep running through my head. If I get to hack through the middle of a decrepit rope bridge strung over a deep chasm, and go swinging across...that would be hella awesome.<br /><br />I don't think it's on our itinerary, though.</p>",

(He's not, by the way, but I'm not going to argue the point with you. His facts are accurate.)<br /><br />So maybe there is global warming, and maybe it's caused by man-made pollutants, and maybe not. But whether or not global warming is going to kill us all next summer, or a century from now, or maybe never, I gotta ask the question: isn't it just a good idea to develop cleaner, greener technology <i>anyway</i>?<br /><br />And aren't the stakes high enough that it's worth going on the assumption that, yes, if we don't start taking better care of the planet, we're all going to die, and let's just fucking do it and quit arguing about it?<br /><br />Oh, and, uh, don't give me any of the usual bullshit about putting hippie environmentalism before economic reality. There's money in green technology. Lots of it -- fat government grants, consumer money, b2b money, everywhere.<br /><br />So really, if you're anti-environmentalism, you're simply shoring up aging industries like the automobile industry, at the expense of new, developing markets. If you vote against environmental laws or initiatives, you're voting to let the government provide shelter for industries that couldn't survive under the scrutiny of those laws.<br /><br />You are <i>anti-market</i>. You, sir or madam, are the fucking socialist hippie.<br /><br />I win.</p>",

Years of ass-kissing famous people in the press and elsewhere had given him, he felt, a sort of license to libelously slander those hated liberals who, from time to time, smoked him out as I did in Chicago, when I defended the young people in Grant Park by denying that they were Nazis and that the only “pro- or crypto-Nazi” I could think of was himself. He sued me and got nowhere. He sued Esquire, in which our words appeared. By then the coming right-wing surge was in view. And so Esquire cravenly agreed to settle with him for a few paragraphs worth of free advertising for his weird little magazine The National Review, hardly the great victory he claimed.</blockquote><br /><br />Hee hee hee.</p>",

About halfway down, we stopped rolling and started free-falling thousands of feet into a gigantic valley.<br /><br />Finally, a few hundred feet above the ground, the wind caught us and set us upright...and we hit the ground running at about two hundred miles an hour, blasting across the valley floor, both of us screaming our heads off with glee, the Stooges howling out of the stereo.

It's even more awesome that so many people have so much free time that they can figure out how to build, say, exact 1:1 scale models of the <i>U.S.S. Annapolis</i>, just using paper! And not just build it, but share it with the world! <a href=\"http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.wordpress.com/\">The Internet sure is neat</a>!<br /><br />With that in mind, I've got my very own papercraft model of a Euclidean object: the plane! You can make this in under 3.2 seconds! Of course, it's not a <i>real</i> plane -- those are infinite! :-)  But it's an awesome papercraft experiment that you can perform yourself, in between bouts of custom-modded-controller <i>Guitar Hero</i> and writing Creative Commons-licensed screeds about models of democratic government in this season of <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>!<br /><br />Here's all you'll need to get started with this project:<br /><br /><img src='http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/thermal-sheet1.jpg' alt='It’s a piece of paper. Yay!' /><br /><br /><ul><br /><li>A piece of paper.

A perfect papercraft model of a plane! You can even decorate your new plane by drawing on it or painting on it. <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=artwork&w=all\">Search around on Flickr</a> and you'll find thousands of examples of DIYers just like you who've decorated their papercraft planes!<br /><br />Next week: simulating fractal geometry by crumpling our papercraft plane into a ball, and learning about aerodynamics by throwing it into a large circular bin!</p>",

The way Martin Luther King's dream is remembered.<br /><br />To hear a politician telling the <i>truth</i> -- the hard truth, the unpleasant truth -- about race and class in America, and then asking Americans to turn aside their differences and their prejudices and to work together...my God.

And maybe if enough people believe -- if enough people can find hope -- then we can work together, rural whites and urban blacks and Latino immigrants and conservatives and liberals, to put aside our differences and remind ourselves of the love we have for this country that is first and foremost a dream of unity and freedom that we all share.

                "content": "<p><a href=\"http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/49344-rilo-kiley-announce-north-american-tour\">Rilo Kiley is touring North America</a>. I mention this only so that I can point out that, despite having heard Rilo Kiley probably a half-dozen times, I can never remember what they sound like. Their music falls off my brain like water off Teflon.<br /><br />Despite this fact, I know a lot about Rilo Kiley the band. I know that Jenny Lewis and Blake Sennett were both child actors, that they had a relationship at some point, and that Jenny Lewis has dated every sensitive guy who fronts an indie band. (Or has some kind of non-sexual deep emotional relationship with them -- Ben Gibbard, represent!) I know there's a lot of tension in the band about how Jenny Lewis is the focus of every media article on the group.<br /><br />I know this because these facts are plastered over every possible surface in the music media. <a href=\"http://www.spin.com/articles/rilo-kiley-solid-gold\">I know this because <i>Spin</i> (which, for various reasons, I have a subscription to) had an entire cover story dedicated to the band</a>.<br /><br />Nowhere in this story is there any actual discussion of the band's music, or even a description of what they sound like. In fact, almost none of the stories I come across on Pitchforkmedia or any other music media outlet have anything to do with Rilo Kiley's music. It's all about...well...who's shagging who in the band. (Or who Jenny Lewis is shagging that's not in the band, but in another band, or is Conor Oberst, or is a pretty singer-songwriter dude who might someday be Conor Oberst.)<br /><br />Now, I know enough about the music industry to know that this is not accidental. Every time I read an interview with these people, they seem quite willing to discuss their personal lives. (They're from Los Angeles, though, so that makes sense. Everyone in Los Angeles is willing to discuss their personal lives with random strangers. Even non-famous people.) Somewhere, some marketing person or PR person is figuring out how to keep Jenny Lewis on the cover of every music magazine, from <i>Filter</i> to <i>Spin</i> to <i>The Fader</i> to <i>Electronic Noise Made By Retards From Poland Quarterly</i>. (I just made that up, of course, but I wish I hadn't. I wish that was a real magazine. I would hella buy that magazine, yo.)<br /><br />And apparently, this is not done by making memorable music. I dunno -- I never heard that solo album she did, and maybe it was awesome. But I'm pretty good at cataloging music in my head, and the fact that I <i>still</i> couldn't tell you if Song X was by Rilo Kiley says something, though I can tell you that Song Y was inspired by Indie Singer Guy Z's brief relationship with Jenny Lewis. The same is not true of, say, Radiohead, or even Simian Mobile Disco, or other lovely contemporaries of Lewis like Leslie Feist or Emily Haines.<br /><br />Again, the whole point is that, at some level, <i>they are allowing this to happen</i>. It's a lot easier to control your public persona than you might think. Anybody know who Leslie Feist's been dating? Me neither, probably because she won't talk about it in interviews. At least, not in the interviews I've read, which is a pretty fair selection. I'm more likely to read an interview with Feist than with Rilo Kiley, because I can remember what Feist sounds like. (I really like Feist and I'm glad she's out there. Even though I'm not a huge fan of every song, I love many of them, and I'm even happy about the ones I don't like as much just being in the world. Leslie Feist, you've got my vote!)<br /><br />None of this has anything to do with actual music, of course. And maybe Rilo Kiley <i>is</i> really awesome, and I just haven't had enough exposure to them to realize how awesome they really are.<br /><br />But I'm deeply suspicious of a band who seems more willing to talk in public about their fractally convoluted relationships than the music they make. That really strikes me as being born more of a desire to be famous than to be a great musician. It's got this brimstone whiff of caring way too much about your public image. And I <i>do</i> mistrust that in musicians, very much so, because it suggests where your priorities really lie.<br /><br />It all reminds me of all the horseshit surrounding Fleetwood Mac in the 1970s, all the hype about who Stevie Nicks was humping every week...which is why, I think, I keep hearing Rilo Kiley referred to as \"the new Fleetwood Mac\".<br /><br />Or maybe they just sound like Fleetwood Mac. I dunno. <em>I can't remember</em>.<br /><br />(To balance my shit-talking, I should point out that I don't really mind looking at Jenny Lewis on album covers. I would rather look at Jenny Lewis than Thom Yorke, even though I'd probably enjoy a conversation with Yorke a bit more. But Jenny Lewis is very pretty.)</p>",

On the radio is playing a lonesome cowboy version of the old murder ballad \"Down In The Willow Garden\", which you may remember from <i>Raising Arizona</i>. It's one of the finest moments in the Coen brothers' filmography, Holly Hunter singing this mournful tune to soothe her kidnapped baby, because it's obviously the prettiest song she knows. The song's melody is a <i>lietmotif</i> throughout that film's excellent score.<br /><br />Anyway, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Everly+Brothers/_/Down+In+The+Willow+Garden?autostart\">here's the Everly Brothers doing the song</a> from their album <i>Songs Our Daddy Taught Us</i>.

                "content": "<p>...when <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080314/music_nm/albums_dc\">somebody does \"Hallelujah\" on <i>American Idol</i></a>.<br /><br />For those of you who really love this song and want more like it, may I recommend you check out Leonard Cohen's early albums? They are depressing, as you'll often hear critics point out...but there are moments of absolute beauty on them. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x-OfkCEbWQ\">\"Suzanne\"</a> has never stopped being a lovely song. Neither has <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGfgMYfdBFc\">\"Chelsea Hotel #2\"</a>, which is about Cohen's brief affair with Janis Joplin, and which may be the most honest love song of all time:<br /><br /><i>I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel<br />You were famous, your heart was a legend<br />You told me again you preferred handsome men<br />But for me you would make an exception<br />And clenching your fists for the ones like us<br />Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty<br />You fixed yourself, you said 'Well, never mind<br />'We are ugly but we have the music'</i><br /><br />And <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aRKZFR5imM\">\"Famous Blue Raincoat\"</a>, which is sad and slow and haunting, and which may be one of the most perfectly written songs ever. On later albums, you can find \"Coming Back To You\", <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEzRXjg1rYE\">\"If It Be Your Will\"</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjtE2-dLjSs\">\"Anthem\"</a>, which is a glorious song.<br /><br /><i>Ring the bells that still can ring<br />Forget your perfect offering<br />There is a crack, a crack in everything<br />That's how the light gets in</i><br /><br />Also, check out <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEOZLQ3d1FI\">John Cale's version of \"Hallelujah\"</a>, which is the version Jeff Buckley was actually covering, not the original.<br /><br />Finally -- <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oitSlHi3MY\">Nick Drake's \"Northern Sky\"</a>, which always reminds me of both Buckley and Cohen, and has a similar emotional effect on me as \"Hallelujah\".<br /><br />Oh, I almost forgot Cohen's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pA5UhNaYw0\">\"Dance Me To The End Of Love\"</a>, which is one of the sexiest songs ever written.<br /><br /><i>Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin<br />Dance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in<br />Touch me with your naked hand or touch me with your glove<br />And dance me to the end of love</i><br /><br />My favorite version is<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsaOyc98JhM\"> the one by a singer named Kate Gibson</a> from the soundtrack to the Jim Cameron film <i>Strange Days</i>, which is a great compilation anyway and worth buying, if for nothing more than the gorgeous song <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tIeZOVKb7Q\">\"Fall In The Light\"</a> by Lori Carson and Graeme Revell.<br /><br />My favorite Leonard Cohen song, though, is still probably <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc_dgbCHs58&feature=related\">\"Waiting For The Miracle\"</a>. I'll record that some day. It has one of my favorite lyrics ever:<br /><br /><i>I dreamed about you, baby<br />It was just the other night<br />Most of you was naked<br />Ah, but some of you was light<br />The sands of time were falling<br />From your fingers and your thumb<br />And you were waiting for the miracle to come</i><br /><br /><i>That's</i> how you do <i>duende</i>, kids. (Tom Robbins once said that \"nobody says the word 'naked' as nakedly as Leonard Cohen\", and he's goddamn right.)<br /><br />Finally, if you <i>really</i> want to break your own heart, listen to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfn8VQz6hhg\">Jeff Buckley's cover of Porter Wagoner's \"Satisfied Mind\"</a>, recorded shortly before his death. I've heard they played this at his funeral...and man, if I'd been there and known him, I don't think I could have handled that.<br /><br />Good stuff.<br /><br />(Random information: I nodded at \"Suzanne\" in my song \"When You Get Here\". The original line goes \"She shows you where to look amidst the garbage and the flowers\" and my line was \"Can you find me here amidst the garbage bins and singles bars?\" Okay, not very similar, but Cohen was in my head when I wrote that line.)<br /><br />(Also, I've got to give a big shoutout to Summer Johnson, who turned me on to both Jeff Buckley and Leonard Cohen, amongst some other amazing music, back in the day. Thanks, babe. Every time I hear \"Chelsea Hotel #2\" I think of our little room and the breeze blowing through it.)</p>",

News</a><br /><br /><blockquote>In typically glib and dry-witted form throughout the wide-ranging 55-minute conversation, the bespectacled Reed bemoaned the current state of audio and other digital technologies, noting that \"it's like the technology is taking us backwards. It's making it easier to make things worse.<br /><br />\"Here's our song reduced to a pin drop -- what, what, what?!\" Reed explained. \"It's like if no one knows any better or doesn't care, it's gonna stay on a really, really low level and people who like good sound are gonna be thought of as some kind of strange zoo animal.\"<br /><br />Reed did express some hope that \"you hear they've got a newer version (of MP3) that sounds better, and you suddenly hear the other instruments that are on the song. They've got to bring up the standard. You have the world open to you now; you can get almost any song in the world as an MP3, and I suppose if you like it you can go out and try to find a version you can actually listen to -- if you like good sound. If you don't like good sound, none of this matters for a second.\"</blockquote><br /><br />Jesus. I'm so fucking sick of hearing this bullshit.

                "content": "<p>I added the lead slide and synth bass for \"Berlin Floor Show\" and a big Sigur Ros/Edge-style fill guitar on \"Sleeping In Flame\" tonight. The latter is buried in the already full mix, but it adds a certain <i>je ne sais quoi</i> to the song. The former takes \"BFS\" into a slightly rougher, nastier territory, and finishes out the instrumentation, I think -- maybe an extremely subtle string drone, but that's about all I could add to it. \"Sleeping In Flame\" needs piano -- piano bass for the choruses and a piano lead line for the bridge/solo near the end.<br /><br />My favorite guitar solo of all time is Keith Richards on \"Sympathy For The Devil\". I love the brutality of that guitar, coming in hard and fast and bright and sharp like a London street punk with a shiv. That's not what the slide on \"BFS\" sounds like, but it was in my head. One day I'll write a song with something that awesome in it.<br /><br />Was listening to the Gutter Twins album at Starbucks around midnight. That album sounds like the album I started writing eight years ago, and it's an album I'd be proud to have made if I were Greg Dulli and Mark Lanegan. (Not that Greg Dulli and Mark Lanegan read my blog, but fuckin-A, boys, take a bow.) It has a unified feel that I'm afraid I'm not going to pull off with <i>Travelogues</i>; I think the production is going to be pretty different from track to track. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but it is what it is, as Daniel Lanois might say. I'm just going to let this album be what it wants to be, for better or worse.<br /><br />I've still got a couple of hurdles before me. I think \"The Big Darkness\" -- which you've never heard -- is pretty much done, instrumentation-wise. It needs to be mixed a little tighter, but it's essentially there. \"Scarecrow\" is being revamped from the version I put out here a while back, the one that's on MySpace -- it's going to have real drums instead of a loop, and a little piano. \"Not In This World\" is easy -- just me and an acoustic guitar, and it'll be recorded last, when I'm doing vocals and mic tracks. \"After The Ice Age\" just needs background vocals and maybe a slightly tighter mix.<br /><br />But \"When You Get Here\" is gonna be a bitch. I love that song so much, but I really don't know what to do with it. I think simplicity is probably best, so I'm going to strip it down, give it a touch like \"Such Great Heights\". (The original Postal Service version, I mean.) \"Scatterlings + Refugees\", \"Requiem For A Diplomat\" and \"Redwood City Station\" are done, except for vocals. The instrumental tracks -- \"The Secret King Of Africa\" and \"Airport Tunnel\" -- are long done, with maybe just some small added touches.<br /><br />\"Entropy\" is going to be a bitch. I've got two totally different versions of it -- one that's fast disco-punk and one that's got more of an industrial feel to it. I'm thinking I'm going to probably use the disco-punk version, but I'm not sure yet.<br /><br />Sigh. So much to do, so little time. I wanted to have this done by my 30th birthday, but unless I lock myself in a room for the next two weeks, that ain't gonna happen.</p>",

It's much more minimal than the rest of the album -- just two guitar lines, a distorted drumbeat and maybe a slide guitar line or a synth, I'm not sure which yet, on the choruses. It sounds really low-fi and dirty, the way it was always supposed to -- pounding and cruel and strung out. It's sitting somewhere between PJ Harvey's \"To Bring You My Love\", Nine Inch Nails' \"Closer\" and the UNKLE track \"Restless\" off their last album (the one Josh Homme sings lead vocals on).<br /><br />I really like the rhythm guitar (which just plays a syncopated E-minor chord with a walking bassline) in particular. It sounds like it's being played on a slashed amplifier that's located in the next room over.<br /><br />And it ends with the delay on the high rhythm part just shitting itself and going into broken slow cycles, Radiohead style. Sounds nice and dissonant.</p>",

It has its own rationale. I think it [began] spontaneously from a number of chemical and electrical processes, coming together -- it seems that that's a fair theory that I've read, the other ones are harder to believe. It's just, here we are. And then, the age of the reptiles was in full swing when an asteroid -- that's another good theory -- an asteroid came along 65 million years ago, and wiped out the reptiles by blocking out the sun and killing the growing season and they ate greens so they couldn't get any meat and they disappeared, and the ferrets grew up into little mammals and the primate line developed and here we are. I don't think we're here on the divine order. I think we're here because a big rock hit the Earth, and I don't know what's next, maybe it'll be the cockroaches. It'd be nice if the insects had a chance.<br /><br />But I think this is all happenstance, and the fact that we have consciousness and this thing we call a soul, this is also all part of the chemical and electrical process. I don't know that it has any real deeper meaning, but it sure feels different from ordinary physical life; I know that. There's something ineffable here. I don't know what it is or how to describe it or what to think about it.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Yeah, that pretty much sums it up.</p>",

            "source": {
                "content": "<p>So, as you may or may not know, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/02/29/ricin.hotel/index.html\">a vial of \"100% pure ricin\" was found in a residential motel here in Vegas last night</a>.<br /><br />I've been calling around trying to get information from Metro, the Feds, and even the CDC, but nobody's gotten back to me yet.<br /><br />The cops are saying they don't think it's a terrorist plot. But I wonder. I really wonder.<br /><br />The story is this: on Valentine's Day, a guy called for an ambulance from the Extended Stay America residential motel over on Valley View and Flamingo (Valley View, the I-15 freeway and the Las Vegas Strip all run parallel to one another). He's got respiratory problems. They take him to the hospital, where he falls into a coma.<br /><br />Then, last night, some guy -- who may or may not be a relative of the first guy -- comes into the motel office with a vial or something. (I'm not really clear on this, and neither are the news reports). Cops are called, the vial is found to be <a href=\"http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/ricin-factsheet.cfm\">ricin</a>, there's castor beans (which ricin is made from) in the room, the maids and the on-scene cops are sent to the hospital, where they are reportedly found to be perfectly fine. Meanwhile, the motel is still, so far as I know, quarantined off.<br /><br />So I have some questions I want answers to.<br /><br />1) The news and authorities keep stressing that ricin can be used to treat cancer. Yeah, maybe, in small doses, but not a vial of it. (200 micrograms is enough to kill an average human. That much ricin will cover half of the head of a pin.) Also, they found castor beans in the room, which suggests that the dude was, in fact, making it himself, possibly actually in the room. I think we can rule out medical purposes here.<br /><br />2) At the Metro press conference I saw a bit of on CNN, the deputy spokesperson said that the man was hospitalized on February 14th for \"respiratory difficulty\". But <a href=\"http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/ricin/facts.asp\">the CDC's ricin fact page</a> says \"Death from ricin poisoning could take place within 36 to 72 hours of exposure, depending on the route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, or injection) and the dose received. If death has not occurred in 3 to 5 days, the victim usually recovers.\" So this guy's in a coma for (as of now) fifteen days, but he's not dead and he's not recovering?<br /><br />3) <a href=\"http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/ricin-factsheet.cfm\">According to the Center for Defense Information</a>, ricin is considered the third most toxic substance after plutonium and botulism. The CDI page also points out that \"Ricin's potential as a powerful terrorist weapon is high, as it is relatively easy to produce and has no antidote. Indeed, it takes so little ricin to kill one human being that its use can be undetectable. It also offers a method to instigate panic and disorder as a 'disabling agent' if used to pollute water and food supplies.\"<br /><br />4) The CDC page referenced above also points out that \"It would take a deliberate act to make ricin and use it to poison people. Accidental exposure to ricin is highly unlikely.\" According to another site I found, which I'm not going to link to here, making ricin is a relatively simple process, but it requires lye and acetone. It's not something you could accidentally do.<br /><br />5) In <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200501/clarke\">a 2005 article for <i>the Atlantic</i> called \"Ten Years Later\"</a> -- a sort of speculative \"what-if\" piece -- former national counterterrorism coordinator Richard A. Clarke suggests a fictional attack on Las Vegas. Vegas, as he points out, is \"Sin City\", almost the very symbol of everything about Western culture that Islamic extremists most despise. And it's a city where literally hundreds of thousands of people walk around, in and out of casinos, all day, every day, totally unchecked. An IED or biological attack on a casino floor could easily kill hundreds or potentially thousands of people. Which leads us to...<br /><br />6) You're telling me that the same federal law enforcement agencies that have been hysterically shrieking about terrorist plots for the last seven years are <i>really</i> just shrugging off the discovery of a relatively large quantity of a deadly toxin (that can be administered via air, liquid or food) in a city where at least two of the 9/11 terrorists hung out before the attacks -- a city which is <i>the</i> symbol of Western decadence? I call absolute bullshit. I think they're not talking, but somebody's shitting their pants right now.<br /><br />7) This is NASCAR weekend in Vegas. 300,000 people at the Speedway. NASCAR is as synonymous with America these days as apple pie and waterboarding. I'm just sayin'.<br /><br />Look: if you read this blog you know that I think the hysteria over the boogeyman of \"terrorism\" is idiotic. I don't see terrorist plots behind every corner. I'm dismissive of most of what Homeland Security does.<br /><br />And I'm telling you that I think there's something going on here that they're not talking about.<br /><br />I'm waiting to see if anybody gets back to me on this so I can cover it for <i>CityLife</i>. I doubt I'll hear anything before the weekend. The likelihood is that if anything happens, you'll know about it when I do. (Cue spooky music.) But if anybody has any more information on this -- not speculation but information -- please let me know.<br /><br />[Update: I spoke to Metro, but they didn't really tell me anything new. They do say their investigation is just about to start.]</p>",

On one hand, it's a hideous thing for McCain to have said. It's something that I really don't want to ever hear from someone who's trying to be president.<br /><br />On the other hand...from a strictly human perspective...I mean, homebody was in a POW camp being tortured by the Vietnamese for five years. Every Vietnamese person he saw (except for that one dude he talks about in speeches who loosened his chains, which may or may not be bullshit) was physically torturing him. I don't really expect his view to be fair and balanced, you know?<br /><br />And I think the author's statement that \"a lot of people have personal trauma in their lives doled out to them by bad guys of every stripe, be they white or black or gay or Jewish or female\" is a bit of a non sequitur. Yes, bad shit happens to people. For most people, that bad shit does not consist of being bayoneted through the testicles, locked in a hole in the ground and tortured for half a decade -- tortured so badly that, for the rest of your life, you can't actually raise your arms above shoulder height. That tends to warp someone's perspective.<br /><br />I'm <i>not</i> saying McCain is right here. He's not. Judging an entire ethnic group based on the actions of a few is wrong. And he should have been able to deal with his hatred over the last, what, forty years?<br /><br />I'm just saying that his situation and experience is rather unique, and that I personally don't feel as if I can judge him as a human being for his views. He went through a hell that most members of modern civilization -- even most military personnel -- cannot understand.<br /><br />Doesn't mean I'll vote for him, of course.</p>",

These are songs for when you're feeling those two sassiest of the deadly sins: Wrath and Lust. You're irritated, you hate the world, and all you want to do is get fucked. A feeling I know <i>intimately</i>. The songs vary as to their mix of anger and desire, but all of them are things I listen to in this mood.<br /><br />None of these are very new songs, and the selections aren't particularly obscure or controversial. This is <i>my</i> Fuck Or Kill mix. You may have some or all of these songs in your own collection...but if so (maybe <i>especially</i> if so), download this and listen to them presented together in this order.<br /><br />Again, I'll be removing this file one week from today, and I'll be checking my download stats. If enough people download this and seem to like it, I'll do another one soon, based on another emotion -- probably \"Irrational Happiness\".<br /><br />Enjoy.

This is awesome late-night driving music...or late night fucking music.</li><br /><li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Treat-Her-Right/dp/B000008LOY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1204114662&sr=1-1\"><strong>Treat Her Right, \"I Think She Likes Me\"</strong></a><br />Treat Her Right was a short-lived band fronted by the late Mark Sandman before he formed Morphine. It sounds like Morphine, but with guitar, which is a good thing. This is a great swamp-blues track. You'll be paying a bit for this, as it's way out of print.</li><br /><li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Pretty-Hate-Machine-Nine-Nails/dp/B000025WXZ/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1204114712&sr=8-3\"><strong>Nine Inch Nails, \"The Only Time\"</strong></a><br />The first NIN song I ever heard, and still probably ranks as the song I've had more sex to than any other. \"Lay my hands on Heaven and the sun and the moon and the stars / While the devil wants to fuck me in the back of his car...\"</li><br /><li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Pre-Millennium-Tension-Tricky/dp/B000001EA8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1204114749&sr=8-1\"><strong>Tricky, \"Christiansands\"</strong></a><br />My favorite Tricky track. Features the lovely and talented Miss Martina Topley-Bird on vocals while Tricky rasps underneath. Great funk riff.</li><br /><li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/To-Bring-You-My-Love/dp/B000W1YYYA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=dmusic&qid=1204114772&sr=8-1\"><strong>PJ Harvey, \"To Bring You My Love\"</strong></a><br />No explanation required. Just listen.</li><br /><li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Sliver-Music-Motion-Picture-Enigma/dp/B000000WJO/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1204114800&sr=8-1\"><strong>Bigod 20, \"Wild At Heart\"</strong></a><br />From the <i>Sliver</i> soundtrack, which was far better than the movie. Nice industrial sex throb music.</li><br /><li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Bloodletting-Concrete-Blonde/dp/B000000QFR/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1204114821&sr=8-1\"><strong>Concrete Blonde, \"Bloodletting (The Vampire Song)\"</strong></a><br />I had <i>such</i> a crush on Johnette Napolitano in high school, and this song was why. Inspired (I assume) by Anne Rice, this is good goth booty music. 80s L.A. death rock is so hot right now.</li><br /></ol></p>",

                "content": "<p>...or much of anything at all in the theater last year or this year, for that matter? (God, I know I saw something other than <i>Cloverfield</i>. I must have.)<br /><br /><a href=\"http://hollywood-elsewhere.com/archives/2008/02/addressing_the.php\">This guy rants about how nobody saw these movies because people are saps who just want happy, happy, joy, joy all the time</a>. I tend to agree in general. I like dark movies. I like depressing movies.<br /><br />But I'm generally totally disinterested in movies like <i>Juno</i>, for the same reason I don't read Daniel Clowes' comics: I just don't care about those kinds of stories. I don't care about quirky teen moms. There's no way that story's going to resonate with me. Sorry. I'm sure it was funny. I'm sure you found it enchanting. Put on some Sufjan Stevens and tell your friends <i>all</i> about it. Maybe you're too easily enchanted.<br /><br />Sometimes it's a beef with the way the story's told, or who's telling it: I absolutely despise the work of Paul Thomas Anderson. (Or P. Thomas Anderson, or P.T. Anderson, or whatever pretentious way he's billing himself these days. How about just P. Thomas A. next time, big guy?) <i>Boogie Nights</i> was a pile of shit, and <i>Punch-Drunk Love</i> was one of the worst things I've ever seen committed to film. He's only second to Todd Haynes on the list of people I wish worked on a garbage scow instead of making movies. He's the reason I didn't see <i>There Will Be Blood</i>.<br /><br />And sometimes, I just don't want to see depressing shit happening to people I'd rather piss on than engage in a conversation with. I like the Coen Brothers' comedies a good deal, but I never liked <i>Fargo</i> at all and didn't like <i>Blood Simple</i> much better and I sure as shit don't want to see some retard with a Prince Valiant haircut murdering rednecks.<br /><br />I like Edith Piaf and I like Marion Cotillard, and I had nothing in principle against <i>La Vie En Rose</i>, but I just couldn't be arsed. Biopics about talented people who piss their lives away don't much interest me, either. It's why I didn't see <i>Control</i>, even though I love Anton Corbijn. I know Ian Curtis's story. I know about his shitty behavior and his pathetic suicide. I just don't care to see it played out on screen.<br /><br />Or at least, I don't want to go and spend $15 to do so. (Ticket plus drink.) I'll watch these movies on cable, maybe.<br /><br />With the exception of <i>Juno</i>, all these movies just seemed ponderous and humorless and dreadful and depressing. You think I need the guy who wrote <i>Magnolia</i> to tell me how life sucks and people are evil and the world is fucked up? Got it, thanks. (I'm not even going into the Julian Schnabel movie about the paralyzed guy. Triumph of the human spirit? Great, fine, got that from the review. Don't want to sit around trying not to snore for two hours while some poor fucker blinks at things.) Terrifying I can handle. Disturbing. Thought-provoking. I like these adjectives.<br /><br />Dreary? Not so much.<br /><br />I'm not looking for <i>The Princess Diaries</i> here. But life is shitty enough without hearing about it from some snide CalArts film school asshole.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to <i>Iron Man</i>, <i>The Dark Knight</i>, <i>Watchmen</i>, <i>Be Kind Rewind</i>, <i>Chaos Theory</i>, whatever Gilliam does next.<br /><br />You think that makes me ignorant of great cinema? Fuck you. Make some and maybe we'll see. Stop playing with your dick and being mopey and bring on the <i>Lawrence Of Arabia</i>, Hollywood.</p>",

                "content": "<p>There's an excellent Poptimist column by Tom Ewing over at Pitchfork about <a href=\"http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/48801-column-poptimist-12\">John Peel's unique position in music history</a>, and why his legacy of educating his audience may never be revived.<br /><br /><blockquote>After Peel's death there was a general assumption-- not much discouraged by the BBC-- that there could never be another broadcaster like him. His unassuming style, pretty much unique among British DJs, is surely part of the reason, but it's also true that the wideband license Peel had to play anything he fancied was increasingly out of place on radio even before he died. The idea of Peel as unique, an inimitably great and generous public servant, keeps his memory alive but does his legacy no favors by suggesting his Reithian project can't be continued.<br /><br />The enemies of that project are easy to finger: They include marketers and pollsters like me, keen to help the BBC and its commercial competitors segment and identify sustainable audience subgroups. But that's not the whole story: If John Peel were starting a career now, as a DJ or perhaps an mp3 blogger, it wouldn't just be marketers that would stop him finding an audience. The digital culture of personalization-- your own last.fm station, your own tailored recommendations, your own Festive Fifties every day of every year-- makes the idea of \"education\" by tastemakers like Peel seem even more antiquated. The sudden left turns and infuriating inconsistencies his shows offered would as likely be resented as embraced. It's probably easier to admire John Peel than it sometimes was to listen to him. But if he was sometimes disappointed in his audience-- and if he often baffled them in turn-- it was because he respected their intelligence rather than pampering their tastes. The renegotiation of that contract is what stands in the way of his successors.</blockquote></p>",

                "content": "<p>Matt Jones has <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/blackbeltjones#2008-02-20\">a bunch of del.icio.us links today about what constitutes a \"go bag\"</a> -- i.e., the bag you keep for an emergency situation.<br /><br />Browsing around, I found a <a href=\"http://www.outdoors-magazine.com/spip.php?page=article&id_article=103\">couple</a> of <a href=\"http://www.skrysak.com/articles/emergencybag.php\">links</a> on the subject. Pretty useful if you're planning on keeping a go bag, and I recommend it. It may sound like retard survivalism, but just remember New Orleans (or San Diego last year).<br /><br />It reminded me that I need to put one of these together again. I have most of the stuff I need. Here's my list of stuff I keep in my go bag, usually. It's not as completist as what these guys talk about, and it should be, but this is really basic stuff.<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>A sharp pocket knife, preferably a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Gerber-06425-Chameleon-Medium-Serrated/dp/B00004WA51\">Gerber Chameleon II</a> (because your finger goes through the hole and it's nigh-on impossible to slip and slice your fingers off)</li><br /><li>A big-ass carabiner</li><br /><li>An \"unbreakable\" water bottle with a looped screw-on lid, which hangs from my backpack strap; where I live, in Nevada, you need as much water as you can carry. Mine claims to be heatable above boiling point as well.</li><br /><li>An LED headlamp and a small LED flashlight; if you've got the space, get a Mag-Lite, because you can use them to bash people over the head</li><br /><li>Three black t-shirts</li><br /><li>A first aid kit</li><br /><li>A bicycle lock, which can also be used as a loop or a flail or to hang heavy things from</li><br /><li>A small roll of heavy-duty \"contractor\" trash bags, which can be used in any number of ways</li><br /><li>A small heavy hatchet</li><br /><li>Cheap plastic lighter to augment my Zippo</li><br /><li>Trail mix</li><br /><li>A solar battery charger for cell phones, GPS, etc.</li><br /><li>Toilet paper</li><br /></ul><br /><br />This is by no means a complete go bag, and I should probably go and pick up a large ALICE pack from the surplus store and load it up. I'd probably also include water purification tablets, a wool blanket, heavy-duty socks, MREs (military rations, Meals Ready to Eat or, apparently, Mostly Rat Excreta), and (as one of the linked authors suggests) wax paper and a china crayon-pencil, for waterproof writing. This is a fairly heavy load, but remember, I regularly carry 50 pounds of gear in my bag anyway (laptop, big hardcover books, cameras, cables, etc.) I can carry about 100 pounds of gear for long distances, though I'd prefer not to. Being overweight and a smoker, I don't move very fast, but I can keep moving all day.<br /><br />Clothing? Cargo pants, black t-shirts, and -- in a real emergency -- probably something approximating a <a href=\"http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/africa/exhibit/sahara/tuareg/6.htm\">Tuareg robe</a>. Which sounds dumb, but again, I live in one of the driest, hottest places on Earth, and in a real emergency I'd rather look like a dorky Jedi than a dead fashion victim.<br /><br />I wear extremely worn, comfortable combat boots every day as a matter of course, but I'd also pack some flip-flops, just in case. And I have a straw cowboy hat which serves me extremely well in the heat -- it's loose-woven enough to breathe, very light, but it also blocks the sun on my face and neck as well as could be expected. Also useful for batting away insects.<br /><br />If I lived somewhere cold and wet -- or even in the tropics -- this would be a much different list, of course. But survival in the Mojave is primarily predicated on keeping hydrated and keeping cool. If I had nothing else, I'd take water with me before anything else.<br /><br />How about you? What do you recommend as indispensable survival gear?</p>",

            "source": {
                "content": "<p>So I'm probably now 3/5ths done with the album. I'm remixing and re-recording everything one last time. I created a new folder for the final album sessions and copied 'n' pasted the bits from all the previous recordings that I liked -- good basslines, good guitar bits, the rendered electronic tracks out of Reason -- so that I can record the final bits, like guitars and vocals. I've mainly been going back and adding complexity: drum fills, doubled guitar parts and lead sections, synth textures, washes, etc.<br /><br />And so, with only a couple of exceptions, the final album recordings are gonna sound very different from what you've heard in the previous recordings I've released. I don't think anything's going to sound totally radically different, but the arrangements are much more textured and nuanced. In particular, I think \"Scatterlings + Refugees\" sounds <i>amazing</i> with electric guitar parts, more drums and a sort of alt.country solo. I think \"S+R\" and \"After The Ice Age\" are gonna be the most radio-friendly tracks.<br /><br />I've learned so much about production and arrangement over even the past couple of years, and I think you'll be able to hear it. The recording doesn't sound slick, but it does sound like it's made by someone who knows what they're doing. My greatest frustration is that I'm not a better <i>musician</i> than I actually am; I wish I was capable of writing and playing really complex guitar parts, for example. But I do what I can, you know? If by some miracle this album takes off, I'll get real players next time.<br /><br />But I'll be honest; I don't really anticipate that anybody's going to give a tinker's damn about <i>Travelogues</i>. My entire musical career, such as it has been, seems to be one big non sequitur. I don't think the music's particularly difficult, so maybe it's just boring or not what people are interested in. It's not Friday night feel-good music and it's not indie-kid-friendly, it doesn't sound particularly of the moment and it's not pretty and shiny on the surface. Maybe the subject matter and emotions it deals with aren't universal. And maybe it's just because I don't have a high, pretty singing voice. If somebody dug up the late Mark Sandman from Morphine, stole a bone fragment, and took the DNA out of it and crossed it with genetic material stolen from Trent Reznor's larynx, it would probably sound a lot like what I hear when I sing in the shower.<br /><br />The music is too moody for the lunchboxes and horn-rims brigade and too electronic for the Tom Waits / Mark Lanegan / Greg Dulli crowd. It's too Americana for the trip-hop kids and too European for the Wilco fans. It's not creepy enough for goths and too creepy for the misunderstood singer-songwriter fans. It's too weird for the high schoolers and too middle-of-the-road for the art gallery crowd. And there's entirely too little dissonant guitar, though there's more than you're probably expecting.<br /><br />I think a lot of people -- my friends and acquaintances -- will like it well enough, but I don't know that it will ever be somebody's favorite album. I don't know if it'll ever save anybody's life, except for mine. (Reason Not To Commit Suicide #481: <em>If you off yourself, Ellis, nobody will ever hear \"Sleeping In Flame\" the way you hear it in your head, with all that space and that wall of purpose.</em>)<br /><br />Making this album has given me newfound respect for all those people who post their bedroom recordings on their MySpace page. Because even if most of that music is terrible to me, it means something to somebody, the same way my terrible music means an awful lot to me. And I wonder how many moments of transcendent beauty are waiting on an empty profile page, with only Tom and his white t-shirt to hear it. So many people can't communicate with others except through the art they make; every unheard song is like one sentence of a suicide note, people slowly dying because they've hung their heart for all to see...but nobody ever sees or knows.<br /><br />These days, I think that all of my possibilities and all of my life has dwindled down to the art I put into the world; the songs I write, the words I nail down on this keyboard, and the stories I'm trying to tell. Dying doesn't scare me much, anymore -- I could use the rest -- but the idea of my songs sitting unheard on some darkened hard drive or gathering dust on some unplayed anonymous CD-R in the far back box of somebody's old collection in the junk closet until entropy and bit rot erases them from the world...that's <i>real</i> death. All those moments, as Rutger Hauer says at the end of <i>Blade Runner</i>, lost in time, like tears in rain. They matter more to me than I do. And I think they have more value than I do to the world. I don't want them to disappear like all those beautiful unplayed songs on all those MySpace profiles.<br /><br />So I'm going to ask you to do me a favor. When I'm done with <i>Travelogues</i> in a few weeks, I'm going to put it here as a zipped download. I'd like you to download it, load it up in your iTunes or Windows Media Player or iPod or Zune, or burn it to a CD, and listen to it. I mean <i>really</i> listen to it, not just put it on as background audio to cleaning your house or doing homework or whatever. Pay attention to it. Drive around your town aimlessly at night with it on your stereo. Go for a walk with your music player and your headphones. Listen to it, if you can dig it, the way I listened to Springsteen's <i>Nebraska</i> or Peter Gabriel's <i>So</i> or Radiohead's <i>OK Computer</i>. Start to finish. I know it's a presumptuous request, but I hope you'll understand why I make it.<br /><br />If it doesn't do anything for you, that's absolutely fine and no hard feelings. I understand. But if it <i>does</i> -- if even a fragment of what I felt when I wrote these songs reaches you -- let me know. Let me know I'm not just throwing bits of myself out into the dark here.<br /><br />Don't do it because you like me and think I'm a fine fellow. Don't <i>not</i> do it because you think I'm an asshole. Because this has nothing to do with who I am. Who I am doesn't matter. But the work does.<br /><br />And in return, maybe you'll get a little of what I was trying to give when I wrote these songs. Maybe one of them will make you feel happy, or maybe just feel like your own weird feelings aren't yours alone to bear. Maybe one of them will make you fall in love, or realize you're already in love and didn't know it. Maybe you'll just feel a fraction more alive than you did a second ago.<br /><br />If that happens, I did what I was trying to do. And that's all that really matters to me, in the end.</p>",

In fact, I decided to get my bedroom clean and neat and organized.<br /><br />Some personal details here: I live, at the moment, with my parents, for complicated reasons, primarily financial. This means I live in a bedroom smaller than any of the ones I had in high school. However, I am not in high school; I am, mostly, an adult, which means I have stuff now. I have a lot of stuff. I've gotten rid of even more stuff. And will continue to get rid of stuff. Most of this stuff seems to consist of black t-shirts, books and obscure cabling. And I never have time to organize any of it, or do anything other than just throw stuff in there when it gets in my family's way.<br /><br />Consequently, my bedroom looks like this:<br /><br /><img src='http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/compact1.jpg' alt='What a wonderful smell you’ve discovered.' width='500' height='335' /><br /><br />So I got a shelf and some little canvas boxes and I'm trying to get everything organized and put away so that I can get to it when I need it and ignore it when I don't.<br /><br />Here's the problem: I am mad hella crazy disorganized, as a person. I recognize this as a problem. So how does one force oneself to become a totally anal clean freak type? Is it possible? Any books, techniques, ideas?<br /><br />Or do I just throw away anything I can't move in a compact car? (I've considered that. Jury's out. And there's no way I'm tossing out my books. I love my books.)</p>",

                "content": "<p><i>[This is pure fiction. I never saw any bands when I was in high school that got famous later, though I did see Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam in the parking lot of Tower Records in Missoula, MT. I recognized him, but I didn't know from where -- I thought he was just a friend of a friend or something. Apparently this was actually true, as we shot the shit for about ten minutes about our mutual acquaintances. A few months later, I was in Seattle watching Pearl Jam on MTV's </i>Unplugged<i>, and I realized my error.<br /><br />Yeah, I know, not the most exciting story. I did end up meeting Chris Novoselic a few years ago at a digital music conference. He looked like your dad's accountant.]</i>Round And Round was a roller rink that served double duty on weekends as a venue. When we got there, there was already a small crowd of kids hanging out -- mostly weirdos like us from the towns surrounding Haddonfield, a few older punks that had been around the scene forever, some random stoners, one or two thug types, and a few straight-looking kids who probably didn't have anything better to do. A couple of the older ones were brown-bagging forties, and I saw one kid passing around a little flask to his buddies. A cloud of cigarette smoke hung in the night air.<br /><br />I saw Alicia talking to a couple of them. She was wearing a suede jacket with a sheepskin collar and a pair of John Lennon glasses like the ones Val wore. When she saw Steve and Val and I walking up, she shrieked -- drawing curious gazes from some of the crowd -- and ran towards us. She wrapped me in a bear hug.<br /><br />\"What's <em>up</em>, muhfuckas?\" she said, grinning. \"Oh my God,\" she said to Val, \"you look so fucking hot. Seriously.\"<br /><br />\"Thanks,\" Val said, \"you too.\"<br /><br />\"So, hey, the first band's about to start,\" she said. \"We should go in, okay?\"<br /><br />As we walked in, she waved at the people she had been talking to before -- a really tall skinny guy dressed all in black, and a short dude with dyed-red shaggy hair who sported a striped sweater that reminded me of something my mom would have made me wear when I was five. With the vast difference in their height, they looked like a comedy duo. \"Good luck!\" she said. They waved back.<br /><br />\"They're in the second band,\" she said. \"I think he said they're called Nirvana.\"<br /><br />\"I hope it's not fucking hippie music,\" Steve said. \"I couldn't deal with that tonight.\"<br /><br />\"I don't think so,\" Alicia said. She looked back at the little guy in the sweater. \"He didn't smell like a hippie to me.\" She smiled wickedly.<br /><br />I looked back at the dude. He was just sitting there, a beer in his hand, staring at nothing. He had really bright blue eyes.<br /><br /><p style='text-align:center'>* * *</p><br /><br />If this were a made-up story, I'd tell you that I knew I was seeing something special when the Dread Police finished their thankfully short set (punk reggae, just as Val had described it) and the little guy in the sweater took the stage. I'd tell you that I knew I was seeing rock history in the making.<br /><br />But I can't tell you that. They were intense, I'll say that...but there were a lot of intense bands back then. It was almost a prerequisite for underground rock and roll. They weren't bad. Their songs were catchy. I think they probably opened with \"Negative Creep\" -- that sounds right. After the first couple of songs, Alicia leaned over to me and whispered in my ear: \"Pixies, much?\"<br /><br />I smiled. Totally. They even ended their set with a loud cover of \"Monkey Gone To Heaven\", and we all danced our asses off.<br /><br />They were...pretty good. But they weren't the best band I've ever seen, or even the best band I ever saw at Round And Round -- that would have been the Butthole Surfers, that summer before school started.<br /><br />Afterwards, Kurt Cobain came walking by with his guitar and amp. \"You guys kicked ass,\" Alicia said.<br /><br />He smiled sweetly at her, nodded, and just kept walking. And he was gone.</p>",

It's a lot more rock 'n' roll now -- in fact, the new guitar solo between the third chorus and the bridge reminds me of something you might have heard on an old Uncle Tupelo album. No, really. Plus the drums are better, more organic, and it fades in on the hand drums. I like it a lot better -- I think this is more of what I <i>meant</i>, if that makes sense.<br /><br />Four guitar tracks -- two doubled acoustics, one picked electric, and one lead. Nice.<br /><br />(I'm not going to post any more tracks until I've got the sessions finished, at which point I'll up the whole album for your enjoyment.)</p>",

                "content": "<p><a href=\"http://torrentfreak.com/record-label-quits-uploads-catalogue-onto-piratebay-080210\">This post over at Torrentfreak.com</a> really pissed me off. So <a href=\"http://torrentfreak.com/record-label-quits-uploads-catalogue-onto-piratebay-080210/#comment-286542\">I let fly</a> at all the little assholes who keep claiming peer-to-peer technology is \"good\" for independent musical artists and labels. And I stand by what I said.<blockquote>Wow, that’s so awesome that p2p is so helpful to minor label artists! I mean, it’s so neat that, instead of getting paid for the long hours of work one puts into writing, recording and producing an album, one can actually live on the goodwill of grammatically-challenged retards all around the world!<br /><br />Come the fuck on. You wanna steal shit from artists, fine, but don’t talk about how you’re helping them. I’m sick of listening to p2p pundits burbling along about how helpful they are to artists. There’s no politics of liberation here, no high minded idealism. You’re fucking scumbags who just want shit for free and don’t care whether or not the people who make it benefit from their labor.<br /><br />P2P does not help artists make money. Period. Sorry, I’ve heard all the arguments, and none of them hold water. Having your shit on Gnutella or TPB is a good way to get exposure…but exposure does not translate into “making a living”. Something you little piglets don’t ever seem to understand is that, in order for an artist to profit from touring, somebody has to underwrite the costs of touring. That somebody — not counting rich kids who can afford to take three months off and pay for vans and equipment and personnel costs — is called a “record label”. And labels won’t fund tours — which artists make the majority of the profits from — if the label can’t make money off album sales, which is where their profits come from. And you’re not making money selling merch unless you’ve got yourself a fan base…which, by and large, comes from touring.<br /><br />The difference is that big labels are part of massive conglomerates, who are far better at riding out the costs of producing and distributing music than small indie labels. If Sony BMG sells a million less copies of a Britney Spears album because of Net piracy, no big deal.<br /><br />But a small label isn’t doing twenty million units for every album. In most cases, they’re lucky if they’re moving 100,000. So you’re hurting the indies a lot worse by not buying the music you like that they are responsible for bringing to you.<br /><br />But none of you actually know that, because you’re perfectly content to wax rhapsodic about the destruction of the record industry with absolutely no goddamn understanding of how that industry works. You have some stupid fantasy that Cory Doctorow sold you and that’s the limit of your knowledge. Christ, it’s like listening to Star Trek fanboys trying to expound on how NASA builds spaceships. You’re clueless little dweebs.<br /><br />I’m not saying that the record industry in its current form is a good thing. It’s not. But YOU’RE NOT OFFERING ANY REAL ALTERNATIVES, except suggesting that musicians should be happy with whatever you deign to throw their way, like medieval beggars standing outside the gates of the palace begging for scraps. You’re tearing down a corrupt system and replacing it with precisely nothing at all.<br /><br />Well, fuck you, you little douchebags. You are not heroes. You are not liberators. You just don’t want to pay for the art you enjoy. Keep justifying that to yourself. And when the indies keep shutting down, and all you’re left with is the mindless pop crap that the majors know they can sell to hormonal teenagers from Vancouver to Cape Town, don’t fucking whine, because it’s your fault. Accept responsibility for your sociopathic behavior.</blockquote><br /><br />Yeah. That's how we roll in <i>my</i> motherfucking hood.</p>",

                "content": "<p><em>[Holy shit, I'm over 10,000 words into this. I haven't gotten that far into any fiction in a long time. I know these excerpts don't make any sense, by the way. And they're not in direct linear order. There's lots of stuff in between. Also, can anybody name the Okkervil River reference in this one?]<br /><br />[Oh, yeah: this one's for Jeremy Snyder, wherever you are, bro.]<br /></em><br /><br />The first day I ever saw Val Sutton was the first day of freshman year. She'd gone to Kenwood Christian School before that, but Kenwood only went as high as eighth grade. And so, probably to the horror of Kurt and Meredith Sutton, she'd been cast down amongst the unclean hordes of Forreston High.<br /><br />And she looked it too, man. That first day, she was wearing a denim overall dress that went down to her ankles, a lacy frock kind of thing with a neckline higher than my t-shirt, and a pair of those two-tone saddle shoes that Catholic girls wear, even though Kenwood was Episcopalian or Lutheran or Hutterite or some goddamn Protestant thing. Her hair was pulled back in a ponytail so tight you could almost hear her scalp screaming. She wore no makeup and no earrings. (Not that I had any room for fashion critique; I think I showed up that day in a Vanilla Ice \"To The Extreme\" t-shirt and a pair of neon MC Hammer harem pants.)<br /><br />I don't know why I noticed her that day, except maybe that she had this rabbit look in her eyes like she was going to bolt at any second. I think I probably felt sorry for her.<br /><br />The next time I saw her was two months later. I was hanging out in Bradbury Park by myself, sitting on a picnic table in the shade near the bottom of the hill and working my way through a half-pack of my dad's Camels that I'd filched off the dining room table when he wasn't looking.<br /><br />\"Can I have one of those?\" I turned and there was Val, dressed a little less like a door-to-door missionary this time, in a black t-shirt and tight pegged jeans with little bows at the ankles. She still had the saddle shoes, though.<br /><br />\"Uh, yeah,\" I said, and handed her one. She lit it with my matches and sucked the smoke into her mouth, but didn't inhale.<br /><br />\"Thanks,\" she said. \"Can I sit here?\"<br /><br />\"Yeah,\" I said. She climbed onto the table next to me.<br /><br />\"You're Valerie, right?\"<br /><br />\"Yeah,\" she said. \"But I don't like being called that.\"<br /><br />\"Sorry.\"<br /><br />\"It's okay. You didn't know. Val.\"<br /><br />\"Okay, Val.\"<br /><br />We talked a little bit about school, about the teachers we both hated -- Mr. Olafsen, the history teacher, being a widely-known and particular asshole. Finally, she put her cigarette out carefully on the ground.<br /><br />\"I gotta go,\" she said. \"Thanks for the cigarette. I'll see you around.\"<br /><br />\"Yeah,\" I said. \"I'll see ya.\" I watched her walk away. It just seemed so weird -- some preppie Christian chick bumming a smoke off of me.<br /><br />A couple of days later, I was walking home down Cherry Street. A couple of older kids were parked a block away from the school. They were all wearing clothes that looked, to my freshman eyes, like something a crazy homeless person might put together out of stuff they found on the street. They wore oddly-shaped sunglasses.<br /><br />And they were listening to this music, like I'd never heard on MTV or the radio, this strange, dreamy rock and roll with guitars that sounded like chainsaws in a cave. \"<em>Listen to the girl, as she takes on half the world, moving up and so alive, in her honey-dripping beehive...</em>\" some guy sang. He didn't have a high voice like Vince Neil or Janey Lane from Warrant or any of the other rock bands I knew. His voice was low and almost conversational.<br /><br />I walked past them nervously. They looked like druggies.<br /><br />And, horror of horrors, as I passed the car, the guy in the passenger seat rolled down the window. He had a ponytail and a bunch of earrings in his ear, and one in his nose.<br /><br />\"Hey, dude,\" he said, \"you got a smoke?\" Laughter from inside the car.<br /><br />\"Uh, yeah,\" I said, just like when Val had asked me, and I pulled one out. I handed it to him. He nodded and lit it with a big wooden match from a box.<br /><br />\"Thanks, man. What's your name?\"<br /><br />I told him. I didn't walk away. I didn't know why. I just stood there.<br /><br />\"Nice to meetcha. I'm Mike. You a freshman?\"<br /><br />\"Yeah. Are you seniors?\"<br /><br />\"I am,\" he said. He jerked his thumb at the girl behind him at the wheel, who I couldn't see very well. \"She's a junior.\"<br /><br />\"I like your music,\" I said, and I did, though I didn't know why I liked it. It was weird. But it was cool, and kind of beautiful.<br /><br />\"Right on,\" he said. \"It's the Jesus and Mary Chain.\"<br /><br />\"I've never heard of 'em,\" I said. He laughed. \"They're from England or Ireland or something. They're not real famous, but I fuckin' dig em, man.\"<br /><br />\"That's cool,\" I said, completely meaninglessly.<br /><br />\"Hey,\" said the girl behind the wheel. She kind of looked like a prettier version of the guy, Mike. \"You wanna hang out with us? We're going over to Granny's for coffee.\"<br /><br />\"Cool,\" I said. \"Hop in,\" said Mike the ponytail guy, and I jumped in the back seat.<br /><br />And that was how I met Mike Webster and his sister.<br />About six weeks later, I walked up to Alicia's car after my last class. I had the Jane's Addiction tape she'd loaned me the day before, which I'd carefully dubbed onto one side of a Maxell 90 minute tape with my shitty little K-Mart boombox. My dubbed tape collection was rapidly filling up, thanks to the Websters -- The Pixies, the Sex Pistols, David Bowie, The Cure, Primus. I was a ready and willing student. My Vanilla Ice shirt had gone into the dumpster behind the house, replaced with ripped black jeans (to my mother's horror) and a Ramones t-shirt I'd bought at the record store in Worthington when I'd gone over there with my dad for a dentist's appointment.<br /><br />When I got to the car, I saw Mike and Alicia...and there was Val Sutton. Gone was the clenched-fist ponytail and the pegged jeans with the bows. Now her hair was dyed a deep shade of red and she wore a sun dress with a leather jacket over it and knee-high combat boots. She had a sort of crushed velvet old lady hat on that hung loosely around her face.<br /><br />\"Hey,\" Alicia said. \"You know Val?\"<br /><br />\"Yeah,\" I said. I gave her a little wave. \"Hey.\"<br /><br />\"Hey,\" she replied. I saw Mike give his sister a wink, but I didn't get it, not then.<br /><br />\"Hey,\" Alicia said. \"Have you got that Jane's tape? I was gonna let Val borrow it after you're done with it.\"<br /><br />\"Yeah, I got it right here.\" I reached into my backpack and produced the tape. <em>Ritual De Lo Habitual</em>. I handed it to Val.<br /><br />\"You'll fucking love that, sweetie,\" Alicia said. \"It's so fucking good.\"<br /><br />\"Let's go get coffee,\" Mike said. He howled for no apparent reason and flung himself over the hood of his sister's car.<br /><br />\"Cunt!\" she shouted. \"Don't break my fucking car!\"<br /><br />\"Car!\" he shouted back at her. \"Don't break my fucking cunt!\" He rolled his Rs theatrically.<br /><br />Val and I looked at each other, bemused. I could tell she had as little idea of what to make of all of this as I did. But we got in the car anyway, and Alicia hit the gas and roared off, some Ministry song blasting at full volume.<br /><br />And that was pretty much that.</p>",

                "content": "<p><em>[Another excerpt, which might give you a clue as to what sort of story this is.]</em><br /><br />I don't know if it was real, if it was part of everything that happened later, if it was a dream. I don't know.<br /><br />I got up out of bed and squinted the sleep out of my eyes. The sky was light, but the sun hadn't risen; the world was painted in shades of pale blue and gray. I ran my hands over my face. I stepped into my jeans and pulled on my jacket without bothering to put on a shirt. I left my Chucks where they lay, piled in the corner of my room next to the makeshift bookshelf I'd built out of filched plastic milk crates and pineboard.<br /><br />The air was cold, cold, cold on my face as I stepped out my front door, pulling it quietly closed. I stood on the porch of my house and felt the chill rising up through the boards and the peeling house paint my dad had covered it with years earlier.<br /><br />There was no one on the street. No cars. No sound of cars from Main Street or Bradbury Street, a few blocks away. No big trucks bringing produce into the grocery store, three blocks down and a block over. No sound. Nothing. Not a bird.<br /><br />I reached into my jacket pocket and pulled out my Luckies, but the pack was empty. I crushed it and put it back. I blinked, slowly. If I was thinking, I can't remember what I was thinking. Nothing.<br /><br />And I looked up, and saw a pair of shoes dangling from their laces, hanging off the power line at the corner, slowly twisting back and forth. I'd never seen them before. I squinted at them.<br /><br />They were my Chuck Taylors.<br /><br />I walked down to the corner, my bare feet rasping on the cold cracked concrete of the sidewalk. I looked up.<br /><br />They were definitely my Chucks. I could see the anarchy symbol, carefully traced onto them with dozens of precise ballpoint pen strokes.<br /><br />There were shoes hanging from the power line at the next corner, too, but I couldn't see what kind, so I walked across the empty, silent street.<br /><br />They were also my Chuck Taylors. The 'A' stood out against the red canvas like an accusation.<br /><br />I just looked at them. And then I looked at the next corner, and saw shoes hanging from that power line.<br /><br />And the next, and the next. Down Cedar Street, at every corner, a pair of red Chuck Taylors with a black 'A' lettered over where the ankle bone would sit in each shoe. I could see them down at the corner of Bradbury, hanging from the street light, which was blinking red. Beyond Bradbury, they dwindled into small dots, swaying back and forth like they'd just been thrown there.<br /><br />\"All places shall be Hell that are not Heaven,\" I said out loud. I think I said it out loud.<br /><br />Someone else was there, standing on the corner of Cedar and Bradbury. Someone who hadn't been there a moment before. Something was very wrong with them.<br /><br />I turned and walked quickly back across the street, toward my house. I didn't run. I didn't want to look at the person down the street. Something was very wrong with them.<br /><br />I took the steps up to my porch in one big jumping stride. I stepped through the door with a crawling sensation in all the nerves on my back, as if someone was reaching out a hand to pull me back.<br /><br />I closed the door and locked it. I didn't look through the window at my porch.<br /><br />Something was very wrong with them.<br /><br />I went back to my room and I took off my jacket and my pants and threw them down next to my red Chuck Taylors, which still lay together next to my bookcase. I slid under my sheets and my comforter and I turned my back to my window, because I didn't want to see anyone who might be there. I closed my eyes tight.<br /><br />I fell back into sleep, and if I dreamed, I do not remember my dreams.</p>",

                "content": "<p><em>[Here's a little excerpt for you, from something I'm messing around with. I don't know if this will ever see the light of day as part of a larger work, but I like it a lot, so I'm putting it here. Most of the details are autobiographical, with one exception: I was never skinny.]</em><br />Anyone who's a product of the American educational system knows that high school is first and foremost a stage production, stylized and ritualistic as a Japanese Noh play or the commedia dell'arte. There are a set number of roles, mostly handed out the first few weeks of freshman year, and while there's a tiny bit of room for improvisation, the interactions between the actors are choreographed with precision borne of endless repetition.<br /><br />Everyone hates the preppies and the jocks, who preen like rare birds and kick the shit out of everyone else. The stoners and the greasers have an uneasy alliance. None of them pay attention to the band geeks and the speech and debate geeks, who hold a slightly elevated status over the math and science geeks, who play chess endlessly after school as a stimulating way to avoid inevitable ass-beatings. There's the squeaky clean Christian kids, who are usually preppies by proxy, and who never get invited to keggers until junior year, when they inevitably have a lapse in faith and turn into major drunks and whores. There's the Future Farmers of America hick kids, who inhabit a weird space all their own, an alternate anachronistic dimension where it's perfectly acceptable to stick your hand up a sheep's ass. The gay kids, who are always in choir, and who learn very quickly to either keep their heads down or cultivate such a ridiculous presence that they're simply regarded with bemusement.<br /><br />You think I'm stereotyping? Then you're either an amnesiac or you're fooling yourself. Every year, there are new faces in every old role, like some local Shakespeare troupe. Walk into any high school in America and you'll see the same kids you saw every single day of your four year tour. The haircuts and the soundtrack changes, but that's about it.<br /><br />It's life or death down there, in between the varsity spirit hand-lettered posters and the endless rows of identical lockers and the baleful glares of teachers who've been baking too long in the fallout of this teenage wasteland, and who have grown sick and twisted and tired and bitter, nothing more than shells of the bright young educators they once dreamed of being. Every social loss or gain is a tragedy or a victory, and all love is true love, even if it's nothing more than a flirtatious look shared across an English Composition classroom that still smells like 1955, all chalkboard dust and and half-understood desires.<br /><br />Maybe you don't remember, but I do. I never forgot. And maybe the ghost that haunts me the most is the specter of a skinny, slump-shouldered kid in a Pixies t-shirt and a Vietnam-era surplus store Army jacket, dark hair hanging in stringy ropes to his shoulders, scruffy jeans ripped carefully at the knees; under his arm a copy of whatever rebellious novel he's tracked down in the library this week. Jack Kerouac. William Burroughs. S.E. Hinton. Whatever. That ghost has a little silver cross dangling from his left ear -- only and ever the left ear, only faggots have earrings in the right ear, and fuck what Mike Webster said about that, he was just fucking with us anyway -- and Chuck Taylors with an anarchy symbol drawn in the same meticulous ballpoint ink as the SOUNDGARDEN and the HUSKER DÜ and the SKINNY PUPPY carved into the cheap denim of his Trapper Keeper.<br /><br />I see that ghost on a dozen street corners a day, every time I drive by some school and see some sophomore sitting by himself out on the curb after everybody else has gone home, bobbing his head to whatever music he's using as triage to hold his fucked-up existence together. He's got an iPod and my ghost has a dented cheap Walkman knockoff; where my ghost had the 'Mats and the Pixies and the Clash, he's got the Arcade Fire or the National or even some shit like Taking Back Sunday. But they are twin brothers, him and my ghost, sons of no one, bastards of young, and if I could I'd pull my car up and tell him not to be so scared, because it really does maybe work out in the end, and the horror fades.<br /><br />But I can't tell him that. He wouldn't listen. And he'd probably think I was trying to get all pedophile on him. I can't save him, any more than anybody could have saved me. So I just pull away and turn up my own rock and roll and go on pretending I'm an adult, and any of this shit matters in the end.</p>",

                "content": "<p><p>I thought this was worth posting: a few weeks ago, Alex Steffen over at Worldchanging sent out an email to some friends (including myself), asking the following question:</p><br /><blockquote><br />  <p>What would America look like if 1970s environmentalism hadn't met such a quick and brutal end? What would sustainability itself look like -- would we all be living in a world of arcologies, living machines, and whalesong?</p><br /><br />  <p>Would America be a green superpower? Or would we simply be Europe, living better on less? Or would we be living in a stagflationary sweater-vest hell? What do you think might be different if that election had gone differently, and what lessons might it have for us this year?</p><br /></blockquote><br /><p>My response -- which Alex <a href=\"http://www.worldchanging.com/archives//007752.html\">posted in the comments to his post on Worldchanging</a> -- was this:</p><br /><blockquote><br />  <p>I think people would have figured out a way to make sustainability ridiculously profitable a lot earlier in the game. And then they would have spent the money on coke and ridiculously expensive krill-based nouvelle cuisine. Imagine a cross between <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Greening Of America</span> and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">American Psycho</span> and you're getting the picture.</p><br /><br />  <p>Seriously, though: I've always believed that environmentalism has been crippled by all the weird bullshit attached to it. Sustainability and Native American rights have fuck-all to do with one another, for example, but you would have gotten lynched if you'd suggested that to hippies in the 70s. (I'm not minimizing Native American rights, of course, but you take my point.) Environmentalism has traditionally been handcuffed to the most ridiculous aspects of post-60s Leftism.</p><br /><br />  <p>We've been changing that in this new century, thanks in large part to people like you and Big Bruce Sterling (and, to a much lesser extent, um, me). But if Carter had been elected? Was the hyper-capitalism of the 80s connected entirely to Reaganism? I like to think my first statement would have been the case. There's a lot of money to be made in cleaning up the environment, and the best part -- if you'll forgive my cynicism -- is that much of it comes from fat government contracts.</p><br /><br />  <p>I think you would have seen a weirder form of socialist-capitalism emerge. And I do think that we'd be a good deal less consumerist as a society.</p><br /><br />  <p>And the fiction writer in me deeply digs on the image of an alternate <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Gekko\">Gordon Gecko</a>, in an Armani suit woven from renewable bamboo fiber and Nia Peeples yuppie glasses made from recycled pressed sunflower seeds, moving billions of dollars between coal-pollution suppression firms and multinational reforesting conglomerates.</p><br /><br />  <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Gekko#Representative_quotes\">Green is good</a>. Green is right. Green works.</p><br /><br />  <p>Heh.</p><br /></blockquote></p>",

                "content": "<p>I was at Starbucks again late tonight, working on stuff. Around 4am I decided to head home. As I approached the corner of Flamingo and Paradise (where, you may remember, <a href=\"http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/?p=82\">I found a bloody shirt a few months ago</a>), I saw a pretty girl standing on the southwest corner, next to the gas station, trying to hail a cab. She was weaving a bit.<br /><br />Then she fell over, into the street.<br /><br />I jogged over, pulling my headphones off, as another man (who was filling up at the station) ran up to help her. She was crying and shrieking. At first, I thought she'd hurt herself, but she didn't seem to be physically hurt. Her makeup was streaked down her face and she was in hysterics. The man and I helped her to her feet and she clung to him like a baby.<br /><br />She was tall, very pretty, young, in her twenties. Platinum blonde, well-groomed, or she had been when her night began. But her nose was leaking blood and snot like crazy, and she was completely off the fucking reservation, not to mention wearing a skimpy black and white cocktail dress, impractical high heels and no jacket in 40 degree weather, like she'd been out at expensive places and hadn't expected to be out in the cold at all. She was shivering and screaming that she had to get to the Hilton or something horrible was going to happen. I looked down and noticed that she had three puppy-dog paw prints rubber-stamped in black ink on the center of her right foot, like something a little kid would do.<br /><br />The man offered to give her a ride in his van, and we tried for several minutes to get her to climb in. But she was out of her mind. The security guard from the gas station came out and told the man to move or he'd call the police. I discreetly took the man aside and told him maybe he ought to let the cops deal with her. Not that discretion was really necessary -- I could have stood two feet from this girl and told the guy we ought to take her out in the desert and sport-fuck her until the sun came up, and she wouldn't have noticed.<br /><br />She just kept screaming that she had to go -- first to the Hilton, then to the Hyatt, and then to \"51 Minds\". I asked her what that was. \"It's near Sahara!\" she screamed. \"I need to go...oh, my God, I need to go right fucking now...I need to go to the HILTON!\"<br /><br />Eventually, he got her into the van, where she crouched on the floorboard of the passenger side in a fetal position, and they drove off. The security guard told me a cab had dropped her off, and she hadn't had money and had tried to get money from the ATM inside the station, but couldn't work the ATM and had finally stumbled out onto the street, which is when I saw her fall down.<br /><br />\"Crazy drunk bitch. She's lucky that nice man's helping her,\" the security guard, a small grizzled Filipino or Vietnamese guy, told me. \"She's lucky a bunch of niggers didn't find her. They'd take her home and fuck her in the ass.\"<br /><br />After that, I dunno. And normally I'd just chalk it up to coke or meth. But I've seen lots of people on lots of different shit, and I've seen raving tweaker lunatics, and this was something else. This girl was genuinely terrified of something -- something that had happened, or something that was going to happen if she didn't get to where she was going. And she didn't <i>look</i> like a heavy tweaker -- she was in good physical shape, none of the usual lines on her face, nothing like that. She was obviously fucked up on something...but I'm wondering if it was something she took on purpose or not. Someone who got dosed with something without their knowledge would act like that, I think.<br /><br />I Googled \"51 Minds\" and it turns out it's <a href=\"http://www.51minds.com\">a production company</a> that does reality shows like \"The Flavor Of Love\" and \"The Surreal Life\". They seem to film in Vegas a lot, based on random casting company links and production credits, but they don't have a permanent local office, or one that I can find. And this girl was pretty enough to be on one of those shows. She was pretty adamant about getting either there or the Hilton -- I think she said \"the Hyatt\" by accident, because she only said it once -- and I can't think of any particular reason why a random tweaker would be so desperate to get to some production company's office in the middle of the night.<br /><br />I don't know. I hope she's alright. If I thought she was just another random coke whore, I'd be more bemused than anything else. But again, I've seen people fucked up on everything from crack to PCP, and this was something weirder than that.<br /><br />I should just start bringing a video camera when I go out for coffee, huh?</p>",

            "source": {
                "content": "<p>I've been thinking a lot recently about the nature of depression, following Heath Ledger's death. (Though now it appears that he may not have killed himself after all, which makes me deeply regret my earlier comments, though they were made out of a heartfelt anger that someone as talented as Ledger, with a small child, would take his own life.)<br /><br />Tonight I watched an excellent film called <i>Neverwas</i>, about a psychiatrist (Aaron Eckhart) who gets a job at the hospital where his father, a famous children's novelist (Nick Nolte), was once remanded for his suicidal tendencies (which he later made good on). Eckhart's character is haunted by the memory of finding his father's corpse hanging from a tree, and he can't sleep. At one point in the film, he says to his childhood friend (Brittney Murphy) \"Sometimes I just want the night to be over.\"<br /><br />The line resonated with me, because it's a feeling I understand to my core. I've never been clinically diagnosed as bipolar, but every bit of anecdotal evidence suggests that I suffer from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_II_disorder\">bipolar II disorder</a>. I've had any number of severe depressive episodes, sometimes lasting for months, as well as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomanic_episode\">hypomanic episodes</a> without number. and while I've never made any serious attempt at suicide, I've certainly contemplated it for most of my life, starting in late childhood, and I'm prone to being physically and emotionally self-destructive.<br /><br />I'm not telling you this, by the way, out of that pathetic impulse which drives so many in our society to wear their neuroses as badges of honor. There is nothing particularly interesting or unique about my situation. It's simply the way things are for me. Sometimes it's an embarrassment, when I get hit with it and it's impossible to shrug off or deal with. But mostly it's just life.<br /><br />I have difficulty sleeping at night -- somehow I always end up awake, even if I make a concentrated effort to keep a more normal schedule (asleep by midnight, up by eight a.m. or so), as I've been doing the past few weeks. I'm not sure why -- circadian rhythms and so on, I suppose, but it's something I've dealt with my entire life, just like my depression. I seem to function best if I go to sleep around dawn and wake up around noon or one in the afternoon -- I can still deal with the waking world during the latter half of business hours, but I have all of the dark hours to myself. I have no idea if this is related to the depression I suffer, or if it's a separate issue entirely.<br /><br />But the point is that there are good nights and there are bad nights. The good nights are when I feel enervated, creative, excited about whatever shiny thing it is my magpie brain has fixated on that moment. On those nights, I write songs or software, or I work on my novel, or I simply watch movies or read and think about whatever it is I'm taking in. Simply sitting around thinking, for me, is productive; it's all research, so to speak, for everything else that I do. These are the times when I feel most comfortable with my existence, when I feel as if I have a purpose for living. Those nights always end too soon: I look up and the sun is rising as if it never went down.<br /><br />Then there are the bad nights, when my house becomes a narrow-fitting cage, reminding me of all of the chances I've pissed away and the life I might be living, if I weren't so lazy and stupid, and I can't catch my breath at the thought of how much of the small, sad life I actually have made for myself is already over. Every light bulb is dimmer and every shadow is deeper and time crawls on its knees. On those nights, I can't work, can't create anything, can't think; I hunch myself up in a chair or on my couch and I go catatonic, staring at the wall. And I just want the night to be over.<br /><br />The hell of it is, I never know what sort of night it's going to be. The bad nights can go on for months. It makes it impossible for me to be creative or useful in any way.<br /><br />This is something that's hard for people who don't suffer from these feelings to understand. I would love to simply get over it and go about my day. <i>I can't</i>. It's the mental and emotional equivalent of waking up and not being able to move your limbs. Or maybe blurry vision is a better example -- everyone else can see perfectly, but try as you might you just can't bring things into focus. Everyone else is seeing the world in color, and you're just seeing dim dreary shades of sepia and gray the color of dirty water.<br /><br />And almost nothing makes it better. Sometimes I can distract myself, but usually I'm actually too depressed to even figure out ways to stop being depressed, which is no less true for sounding stupid. In my own case, personally speaking, I can tell you that the only thing that can really draw me out of depression is...well, quite frankly, sex. Getting laid has, on more than one occasion, kept the gun out of my mouth, in quite literal terms. It usually makes me feel better for several days -- just relaxed and generally more cheerful. I mean, maybe that's obvious, but I think it runs a bit deeper here, something to do with brain chemistry. And the longer I go without sex, the more likely I am to have long strings of those bad nights. (At least until recently; I've sort of given up on the idea of sex and love and all that shit, and I seem to be doing better in general. In defeat I am triumphant, I guess.)<br /><br />I go back and forth on my attitude toward all this. To be sure, depression has caused me a great deal of trouble in my life, more so perhaps than anything else. It makes it difficult for me to simply buckle down and be a normal member of society. It interferes with my work and occasionally causes problems in my personal life and I suspect that most of my friends are pretty tired of watching me turn into a zombie or a quivering pile of shit every so often. It drives my family crazy and I'm sure it's been hard on the women I've had relationships with.<br /><br />But it's also simply part of who I am, and part of what drives me to do the things I do. And over the last thirty years, I've figured out ways to manage it, mostly. It could be worse -- people with bipolar I disorder tend to suffer psychotic mania, which -- despite what my various editors might tell you -- I've never had to deal with. I get manic sometimes and excitable, and there's probably a lot of times when my mouth can't keep up with my brain and I sound like I'm babbling incoherently...but I've never had a real psychotic episode in my life, save for one unfortunate experience involving hypnotic regression in my mid-teens. (I'm not even sure if that was actually a psychotic episode, or something much stranger and actually external. Maybe I'll tell you about it some time, but not tonight.) That's part of the reason I've never bothered to really seek psychological or psychiatric help. I'm not <i>insane</i>. I'm not delusional -- quite the opposite, actually.<br /><br />Rather, I think I'm like a car with a transmission that gets stuck in first or second or reverse every so often. Of course, when that happens, you usually just sit in your driveway and wrestle with the gear shift until it goes where it's supposed to. Unfortunately, I don't have that luxury...so I just move along in that same gear for a day or a week until it finally gives and everything starts moving again the way it's supposed to.<br /><br />It can be managed. It can be dealt with. I'm proof of that, though I suffer the emotional and physical scars of dealing with it for a lifetime. And that's why I'm always so angry with and contemptuous of people who don't manage it or deal with it, who put a gun in their mouth and spray their brains on the ceiling or slash their wrists and bleed out in a bathtub. I'm angry at and contemptuous of myself for having those feelings, because I know where they come from -- nowhere. I'm always on guard against the treachery of my own misfiring brain, and that's a responsibility I have to accept, as does anyone who suffers from depression.<br /><br />At my absolute worst moments, I have to remind myself that ending my own life would be an incredibly selfish and cruel thing to do to the people who actually care about me. I also have a responsibility to those people to not hurt them by annihilating myself. I take that responsibility very seriously, and I don't have much patience for people who don't. That's why I'm still angry at my friends Sara Harms and Jerry Krasovich, both of whom killed themselves fifteen years ago, back when we were in high school and our real lives seemed like they were never going to begin. We're all soldiers fighting in the same war, and they got killed because they let down their guard. It was stupid of them, though it always still hurts to lose them nonetheless.<br /><br />But it's hard sometimes, when the night drags on and there's nothing worth watching on television and no new books to read and nothing to keep your mind from relentlessly turning back on itself. Hard not to just want all this shit to just be over with, to not have to think or hurt anymore. Hard not to think of ways to do it without hurting anyone, as if that was even possible. (Just walk out of your house, go out to the desert as far as you can -- nobody will know for sure, maybe you just decided to start a new life, right?) Hard not to wonder if there's an afterlife, because it's suddenly not quite as theoretical a proposition as it is on the good nights, when it's just part of philosophical discourse.<br /><br />Hard not to wonder if there's a God, and if there is, whether or not you could take Him in a full-on street fight. Because fuck Him for making a world like this and putting you in it in the first place. If that God exists...man, he needs somebody to kick his fucking teeth in. Like Indiana Jones said: \"You wanna talk to God? Let's go see Him together. I've got nothing better to do.\"<br /><br />I do the best I can...but I've always believed, since I was a kid, that there was a pretty even chance that my life would end at my own hand. The older I get, the less likely that becomes, every single day. There are more good nights and less bad ones. Small favors, right?<br /><br />And now this one is almost done. Time to do some dishes and turn in. Sleep well.</p>",

(Apparently this wasn't true, at least the Mary-Kate Olsen part.)<br /><br />This is appalling. Not only did Ledger always strike me as a bright, honest guy, but he was also one of the very few actors of his generation who struck me as having infinite potential. Even in lighthearted stuff like <em>A Knight's Tale</em>, he showed an incredible amount of charisma and intelligence. I was genuinely pleased to hear about his casting in <em>Dark Knight</em> as the Joker -- he had the smarts to pull the role off, and by all accounts he's excellent in it. He was one of those actors you look forward to seeing in ten, twenty, thirty years, doing good work.<br /><br />And the stupid little shit left a two year old daughter. Fucking <em>bastard</em>. A year younger than me.<br /><br />[Edit: I want to point out, as I did in the comments, that even if his death was accidental, he was still a fucking idiot for messing around with pills in the first place. Anybody who's popping sleeping pills in the early afternoon to maintain is probably in a fairly weird state to begin with. Don't get me wrong -- I'm really sad he's dead. I think it's a genuine tragedy. But he was being either incredibly careless or self-destructive, and I still think that's a shitty way to act if you've got a small child.]</p>",

I didn't even mean to write something like this. It just came out.<br /><br />It's called \"Not In This World Or The Next One\". It's about a soldier in Iraq, singing a song in his head to his wife as he's dying in combat, telling her he loves her and he's not afraid anymore and that she needs to forget him and go on. \"Ghosts have no need of companions,\" he says, \"and no need of wives.\" There's no promise of redemption in it, no \"I'll see you in Heaven\". \"Never again / Never again / Never again / Will I haunt you,\" he says. \"Never again / Never again / Not in this world or the next one\".<br /><br />I mean, I know that sounds depressing, but it's not me, it's him, if that makes any sense. It's the guy in the song.<br /><br />I don't know what the fuck to do with this. It's a really good song, I think, but it's also the only thing I've ever written that actually makes me want to cry. (I know that sounds dumb, but I can't help it. It does.) I mean, what the fuck do I know about being a soldier? What do I even know about loving someone so much you tell them to forget you when you're gone, because you couldn't stand the idea of them pining away? The song is as honest as anything I've ever written, and it's not maudlin or a big weepy number or anything. It's actually in a major key, mostly, and the melody is plain. But it's just incredibly goddamn sad.<br /><br />I really don't know what to do with this.</p>",

There are separate functions (heavy on the trig) that create the \"bell\" and the small circles that build it, the triangular \"fringe\" and the long tentacles, which are Bezier curves with crosses attached to their control points. Then other functions randomly place the \"specks\" and crosses (which I just added to look cool) and the big background circles, which are randomly colored and blurred. Finally, a \"glow\" effect is added to the jellyfish, giving it that otherworldly underwater look.<br /><br />This was incredibly complicated to write -- I hadn't done anything in Flash of this magnitude before, and it took a lot of re-acquainting myself with Actionscript and newly acquainting myself with Flash's drawing functions, which I've barely ever used before.<br /><br />I'm pretty proud of it. And I'll be showing it and selling prints of it and other generative pieces at First Friday! More details to come.</p>",

Aside from the multitouch trackpad and the 802.11n, I'm not really very excited by this.<br /><br />Why? Because I don't care how thin it is. After a certain threshhold, thin doesn't matter. My MacBook Pro is plenty thin at, what, 1.5\" wide?<br /><br />The Air has one USB port, no FireWire, a relatively small hard drive, a relatively slow CPU, no Ethernet (not that I use Ethernet). The battery isn't user-replaceable. And it's still too goddamn big. This isn't a sub-notebook, it's just a skinny under-functional notebook. And unless that screen is tolerant of torsion, I suspect it's pretty easy to break.<br /><br />For fuck's sake, Steve, I want a full-fledged Apple UMPC, not this silly thing. <i>Smaller footprint</i>, not narrow footprint.<br /><br />The new Apple TV looks kinda cool. And the Time Capsule dedicated back-up server is nice. But the Air is, honestly, something of a disappointment.<br /><br />I want a multitouch pad, though. Bad.

I don't want to talk to you, I don't want to be your Magic Special Interwubbie Friend, and I don't give a burning rat's ass about your pictures from that party where you got drunk and made out with your BFF. I only use the MySpace to stalk ex-girlfriends and see which one of you was dumb enough to let your password get jacked.</li><br /><br /><li>One of the worst things about the Internet is that it lets us communicate and share. Know what? I didn't need to know about <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?as_q=disney&hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&hs=73s&num=10&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=cory+doctorow+&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=&cr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=boingboing.net&as_rights=&safe=off\">Cory Doctorow's Disney fetish</a>. Really. I used to see Cory at parties, he gave me his old Disney business card, it was cute, I thought it was funny. And that's ALL. The Internet is the best way to realize that other people we thought were fun and sane are, in fact, creepy obsessives. (Apparently, it does nothing to aid the realization that you yourself are a creepy obsessive, otherwise presumably people would stop. And yes, I like synthesizers. And Lovecraft. You see six posts a day on here with synthesizer paper cutouts and Cthulhu furryporn? No. You don't.)</li><br /><br /><li>P2P file sharing really only hurts the sales of the most massively popular media. The long tail ain't properly represented. Wanna see what I mean? Do a search on The Pirate Bay for Kanye West. Then do a search for, say, Daniel Lanois. Go ahead. I'll wait.<br /><br />[waiting]<br /><br />You see what I mean? Dozens or more hits for Kanye. But Lanois? One or two torrents, no real seeders - this is gonna take a while. If you're a discerning patron of music who wants to obtain a copy of Lanois's <i>For The Beauty Of Wynona</i>, you'd be better off looking on iTunes or Amazon or <a href=\"http://www.daniellanois.com\">the man's own site</a>, where you can purchase a high-quality copy of the album, DRM-free, for a reasonable price.<br /><br />This is also why P2P will never be a viable medium for disseminating media. It relies on the tyranny of the majority. And the majority are fucking retards who thought <i>Graduation</i> was a good album. (The best thing about it was Kanye ripping off Daft Punk. Just buy the fuckin' Daft Punk album. It's better.)</li><br /><br /><br /><li>I'm working on this. Really hard. I'll have something to announce soon, inshallah.</li></ul></p>",

No dynamics.

Didn't anybody listen to <i>Nebraska</i>?<br /><br />I like music best when it's intimate. And real intimacy isn't about being as pretty or as fucking, I dunno, <i>meaningful</i> as you can be.

Like if Buffalo Bill from <i>Silence Of The Lambs</i> decided to start a musical career, instead of just tucking his junk between his legs and dancing to The Fall? Or if you just took a recording of, like, a good operatic tenor and played it at 1.3x speed? Creeps me out. I can't listen to it. I don't even care if it's a result of his whole transgendered/postgendered/maybe-still-has-a-dick-maybe-not thing. None of my business. But brother man ain't getting on my iPod with that creepiness.<br /><br />- I now love <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/batforlashes\">Bat For Lashes</a>. Thanks, Scotty, for recommending them, and thanks to Anders Trentemøller for giving them a shoutout in an interview I read today. Definitely my speed.<br /><br />- Speaking of iPods, I'm thinking of starting an online music store where all of the songs have been secretly dubbed over with whispery voices saying things like \"Kill everyone you see wearing a sport coat and a trucker hat\" and \"Strap ten pounds of C4 to yourself and run out onto the starting line at Talledega on race day\". Hipsters will think their iPods are telling them to commit murder. iSon of iSam. Not very profitable financially, but I could definitely rid the world of some evil this way.<br /><br />- <i>Dr. Who</i> Christmas special? Brilliant. Especially the joke about how Londoners desert the city now during the holidays because horrible alien shit seems to happen around Christmas every year now....<br /><br />- No, really. Stop trying to beat <i>Guitar Hero</i> and go buy a guitar. Stop trying to tap buttons in time to the solo from \"Feel Like Makin' Love\" and go learn some Robert Fripp shit. You will be making the world a better place.<br /><br />- Hip-hop acts have finally beaten metal acts for Worst Illiteracy In Artist/Group Names. Now they're just calling themselves by a series of grunting noises. You thought it couldn't get any worse than \"Cum On Feel The Noize?\" This dude calls himself Yung Joc. Makes Prince's whole symbol thing seem positively Duchampesque by comparison, doesn't it?<br /><br />- Hip-hop still has the best beats and the worst lyrics.<br /><br />- Dear Planet Earth And Music Critics Thereon: Um-ba-rella rella rella rella rella rella yeah yeah yeah and <i>that's</i> the best pop single of 2007? Fuck y'all. You've lost your critical faculties entirely. You might make a case for Amy Winehouse or \"1234\" or even that Andy Griffith song by Peter, Bjorn and John, but \"Umbrella?\" Out of your fuckin' minds.<br /><br />- My thirtieth birthday is in March. Someone work up the courage to have sex with me by then. Someone with a vagina, and <i>only one vagina</i>. I ain't starting my fourth decade on the planet by becoming a friend of Dorothy or getting into mutant fetishes. (Well, I'm open to the mutant thing, really.)<br /><br />- Kucinich is a pimp and probably ought to be Emperor of the Earth, but he can't win. I'd probably vote for John Edwards second place, but as it stands, I'll probably actually be voting for Obama. It would be awesome to have a female president, but I don't trust Hilary Clinton very much. And no, I won't vote for Ron Paul, so stop asking. No Republicans in the White House, I don't care how cool you think they are. Fred Thompson appears to be as reactionary and scary as every character he ever played, so fuck him.<br /><br />- I'm still planning to have the Red State Soundsystem album finished in January or February. I'm considering trying to get label support, but I'm very picky about what I'll cede control of and what I won't (like digital sales and publishing rights). I do want to license some of these tracks for commercial use, though. Fine. I'm a whore. I'm a whore who would like to afford a copy of Ableton Live, please.<br /><br />- If I lose as much weight this year as I did last year, I'll be able to do <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttz5oPpF1Js&feature=related\">this</a> by next summer.<br /><br />- And nerds are <a href=\"http://www.airtoons.com/toons.php?toon=12\">still encouraged to get the fuck out</a>.</p>",

                "content": "<p><a href=\"http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/world/view_article.php?article_id=109485\">Stranger than fiction: parallel universes beguile science - INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos</a><br /><br /><blockquote>Is the universe -- correction: \"our\" universe -- no more than a speck of cosmic dust amid an infinite number of parallel worlds?<br /><br />A staple of mind-bending science fiction, the possibility of multiple universes has long intrigued hard-nosed physicists, mathematicians and cosmologists too.<br /><br />We may not be able -- at least not yet -- to prove they exist, many serious scientists say, but there are plenty of reasons to think that parallel dimensions are more than figments of eggheaded imagination.</blockquote><br /><br />I just finished reading <i>His Dark Materials</i> a few minutes ago, so it was interesting to run across this.<br /><br />The many worlds hypothesis makes sense to me. And it also seems logical how, if such worlds exist, they're separated.<br /><br />Basically, it seems obvious that the vectors of parallel realities lie on a perpendicular axis of time to the one we're aware of. Think about it: the usual framework suggests that you've got an infinite number of parallel universes. Some of them are very different from our own, but there are also an infinite number which are only very slightly different: one leaf on one tree in Yellowstone Park is eighteen molecules narrower, or something ridiculous that. In our universe, one of a billion billion electrons in my hand zigged; in the universe next door, it zagged.<br /><br />If so, then clearly, what would differentiate these universes is that different things happen in them. The key word here is <i>happen</i>; we measure the course of events with time. The difference between, say, Gordon Brown's current vector in the universe and Winston Churchill's is very very minute, in terms of three-dimensional coordinates, since both men occupied the same house (10 Downing Street in London) and held the same job (Prime Minister of England) and therefore probably the same offices. In the first three dimensions we perceive, their positions overlap a hundred times a day.<br /><br />But they are separated by decades of time, though they occupy much the same physical locality. To accurately differentiate Gordon Brown's vector from Churchill's, you must describe each vector in four dimensions.<br /><br />So: presuming these parallel universes began almost entirely identically (which is not at all an obvious assumption), what differentiates them? Not time flow; presumably most or all came into existence at the same time, or nearly so. The universe where the electron in my hand zigged instead of zagged must be identical in age, otherwise my hand would not be there for the electron to zig or to zag. It must also, logically, be the same dimensions as this universe, otherwise my hand would not be there again; it would be somewhere else, described by some other 3-dimensional coordinate.<br /><br />So if this sort of thing is true (and I've seen research that suggests this is a pretty good likelihood, specifically some of David Deutsch's interesting experimentation with single-photon slit methodology) what differentiates them? Not that things <i>do</i> happen, and not <i>where</i> things happen...but rather <i>what</i> happens.<br /><br />Which suggests the idea that each universe follows a single, directional, but <i>different</i> timeline. They're all moving forward (presumably). Entropy happens in each one. It just happens in a different way.<br /><br />So if you have a series of single-dimensional lines running parallel to one another, by definition, their position is identical in one dimension but different in another. Imagine laying a bunch of pencils lined up along the edge of a table. They all occupy the same position along the width axis of the table...but they're different along the height axis. (And the depth axis, but that's another problem entirely.)<br /><br />So it seems logical to assume that the difference between the location of these universes is along a second temporal dimension, one of <i>possibility</i>: what happens in each universe. Same time flow, same size...just different possibilities.<br /><br />It also seems obvious that, if these universes do sort of line up like soldiers, that neighboring universes would be nearly identical. If you were, for example, to stand outside of all of these worlds and start by observing our world and its direct neighbors, you'd find them almost identical. The ones on either other side would be a little more different (two electrons in my hand would zig instead of zag), the next two slightly more so, and so on, until you've covered every possibility (I -- or the \"me\" in that universe -- am actually a descendant of Bilbo Baggins, sitting at my table in Bag End, typing this on my little hobbit computer...or I am a sort of sentient sphere living on a massive planet with high gravity, communicating by acidic glandular secretions that etch ideogrammatic representations of my thoughts into the hard ground below me...or whatever).<br /><br />Each world is simply another set of possibilities. A lot of them, of course, wouldn't have survived past the first nanosecond of their Big Bang, and in a lot of them, life would have never taken hold at all, dead and empty universes. In others, life wouldn't have happened yet; in still others, life would already be over.<br /><br />In fact, my supposition about identical dimensions of measurement -- size and time -- would only really apply to the universes directly neighboring our own. Beyond a few universes down the road, you couldn't make any guesses. (You couldn't even necessarily guess in the universes next to ours, but it seems at least likely that they'd be at least that similar to our own.)<br /><br />See, if people like Deutsch are right -- if these universes <i>do</i> interact with one another at a quantum level -- then, by definition, the particles interacting share identical physical and single-dimensional vectors. They exist at the same place and time, otherwise how could they interfere with one another? They simply share different outcomes, different possibilities, different timelines.<br /><br />I don't know why nobody else has made this assumption. It makes quantum theory a lot easier, and you only really need one extra dimension (and maybe two, if you assume that these universes are not simply spread out on a line but exist in sort of possibility clouds, in three dimensions of space) instead of twenty-two or whatever it is in string theory right now.<br /><br />I mean, granted, I have only a slightly better grasp of quantum physics than most non-physicists, but it still seems like an obvious place to start from, if you're going to try and work in this area at all.</p>",

                "content": "<p>My hands are shaking.<br /><br />I went to Starbucks to do some programming tonight. On the way home, I stopped at the grocery store to pick up some milk and other refinements. Normal evening.<br /><br />As I came up to the corner of the major cross streets near my house, I saw smoke coming off of a black truck in the middle of Mountain Vista, at the corner, next to the AM/PM gas station. As I got closer, I could see that it was in fact still on fire, and that the driver -- a middle-aged Hispanic dude -- was trying to beat the flames out with a blanket or something, and get something -- I couldn't tell what through the smoke, maybe a person -- out of the truck.<br /><br />I turned the corner and asked him if he needed help. \"Yes, please, help,\" he said. I whipped a U-turn and pulled into the gas station. I ran over to the truck, and I immediately realized the engine itself was burning. Drops of burning fuel were pouring out of the engine enclosure and landing on the asphalt, where they stayed on fire. There wasn't anyone else in the truck -- the guy was just grabbing his jacket and his cassettes and shit out of the cab.<br /><br />So I ran over and asked the gas station clerks -- who of course were outside -- if they had a fire extinguisher. Some other guy grabbed the one hanging next to the pumps and gave it to me.<br /><br />This was about the moment when I noticed that the truck was about ten feet away from the station's propane tank...and next to the tank was an empty car with a 'FOR SALE' sign in the window. I suddenly had a vision of the burning fuel finally catching down the fuel line, the truck blowing...and then in quick succession the propane tank and the gas tank in the car...which would have ignited the station's fuel pumps. The entire corner would have vaporized.<br /><br />But instead of running away like a sensible person, I took the fire extinguisher and started hosing down the engine, hoping I could put out the fire before the fuel line caught. I almost grabbed the hood to pop it open, but the logical bits of my brain showed me another hideous vision: my hands roasting on the metal of the hood, or the hood blowing open and a plume of fuel-assisted fire turning my face into a marshmallow.<br /><br />And the driver just stood there next to me, staring at his burning truck. He took a turn spraying the extinguisher at his engine, but that was about it.<br /><br />\"<i>Tu habla English?</i>\" I asked. He shook his head. \"Shit,\" I said. \"<i>Mi no habla Español</i>.\" I gestured at the truck. \"If the fuel line catches,\" I said, \"boom!\" and I pantomimed an explosion. I pointed at the propane tank. \"You should get away,\" I said. \"If this blows, that'll blow too. Big boom.\"<br /><br />But he shook his head, either because he didn't understand me or he didn't want to leave. And the engine kept burning. I tried to get the AM/PM clerk to shut off his pumps, but he wouldn't do it.<br /><br />At this point, a cop pulled up and got out of his car, but wouldn't come out from behind his door. I told him what was happening. \"You shouldn't go near it,\" he said, but I kept trying to use the fire extinguisher. \"You're crazy,\" I heard him mutter at me.<br /><br />Finally the fire extinguisher ran out of foam, but the engine was still burning and drops of fuel were still coming out. A huge bright white plume of smoke -- presumably from the antifreeze, since oil burns black -- was coming out of the seams of the engine compartment like a thunder cloud. It stank of burning plastic and chemicals.<br /><br />Finally, a minute or two later, the fire department rolled up in a big yellow fire truck and started hosing it off with their gear. I waited to make sure it was okay, and told the cop and the driver good evening and rolled home.<br /><br />And it wasn't until I really pulled up to my house, three blocks away, that I realized how close I might have actually come to dying. I know it's harder to blow a car's gas tank up than you see in movies...but it was that burning fuel, like napalm, that really worried me. And it was <i>so</i> close to that propane tank. If the truck had blown, it would've knocked the tank off its moorings, which could have easily ruptured it, sending a jet of propane out...and that would have been Boom City for yours truly.<br /><br />If I had any self-preservation skills, I would've jumped in the van and rolled when I realized how big the boom might actually get. But, shit, the dude asked me to help him. I thought maybe somebody was in there. And I didn't want the whole goddamn intersection to go supernova.<br /><br />I mean, who knows what would've happened if I hadn't stopped to help? There were people standing around -- customers at the AM/PM tanks, attendants -- but none of them came anywhere near the truck or helped the driver, except the dude who grabbed the fire extinguisher. And the driver was totally useless -- the entire time, he never seemed to understand the danger he was in.<br /><br />Even if I didn't put the fire out, maybe I stopped it from just burning and burning until the tank went up. So maybe I saved that poor dumb dude's life.<br /><br />But I'm very glad I didn't end up roasted. I'm looking forward to 2008, you know?</p>",

You suddenly give a damn about border integrity, because the automated voice system at your pharmacy asked you to press 9 for Spanish. You cling to every scrap of bullshit you can find to support your ludicrous belief system, and reject all empirical evidence to the contrary. You know the difference between patriotism and nationalism -- it's nationalism when foreigners do it. You hate anyone who seems smarter than you. You care more about zygotes than actual people. You love to blame people for their misfortunes, even if it means screwing yourself over. You still think Republicans favor limited government. Your knowledge of politics and government are dwarfed by your concern for Britney Spears' children. You think buying Chinese goods stimulates our economy. You think you're going to get universal health care. You tolerate the phrase \"enhanced interrogation techniques.\" You think the government is actually trying to improve education. You think watching CNN makes you smarter. You think two parties is enough. You can't spell. You think $9 trillion in debt is manageable. You believe in an afterlife for the sole reason that you don't want to die. You think lowering taxes raises revenue. You think the economy's doing well. You're an idiot.</blockquote></p>",

Oh, and Thom got me a Barnes & Noble gift card, to fulfill my need to read the rest of the <i>His Dark Materials</i> series.<br /><br />(Kaydence got a whole bunch of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse toys, plus a RoboPanda and various other kid stuff. The look on her face when she walked in was priceless. It's really her first full Christmas with the family, and I think she's pretty happy.)<br /><br />Great Christmas. Alex and Laurenn and Thom and Carrie came over last night and we had a big Christmas feast. I made soy bread pudding and blackberry cobbler (Laurenn is rennet-intolerant) and we had ham and all sorts of homemade cookies. Alex had never seen <i>It's A Wonderful Life</i>, so we watched that and <i>Bad Santa</i>, which -- along with <i>Scrooged</i> and <i>Die Hard</i> -- is one of my favorite Christmas movies.<br /><br />Now everybody else is napping and I'm figuring out how to shoot video with my new helmet cam. I hope your Christmas was as awesome as ours has been.</p>",

We are legally within our rights to be free and independent,\" said Means.</blockquote><br /><br />That's pretty awesome. And having lived in that part of America, let me be the first to say to my Lakota cousins: you're welcome to it. Seriously. If you can reclaim your cultural heritage and get past the problems that reservation life has created for you...and also freak out all those toothless fucking inbred redneck bastards who dot that beautiful land with their trailer parks and copper mining pits...I will support you 100%. Hell, put the rednecks in reservations.<br /><br />This is awesome. I'd actually like to see this happen, for real.</p>",

The song is about an old Irish immigrant couple, arguing on their deathbeds, and if you play it at the right moment, I'll cry.<br /><br />The full verse goes:<br /><br />Kirsty: You're a bum, you're a punk<br />Shane: You're an old slut on junk / living there almost dead on a drip in that bed<br />Kirsty: You scumbag, you maggot / You cheap lousy faggot / Happy Christmas, your arse / I pray God it's our last<br /><br />Which doesn't sound particularly lovely, I know.

His music was the reason she became a singer-songwriter, and in fact she reviewed his album <i>High Country Snows</i> for <i>Rolling Stone</i>. I grew up listening to Fogelberg albums (that's vinyl, folks).<br /><br />So I was really not happy to tell her, a few minutes ago, that <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071217/ap_en_mu/obit_fogelberg\">Fogelberg had died of cancer at the age of 56</a>. She started crying. Hard. (This despite the fact that, the one time she ever actually managed to speak to Fogelberg, he was a complete asshole to her.) I felt awful, and weirdly shaken up; my entire life, this guy and his work had such an effect on my mom. It's almost like someone I know dying.<br /><br />Once I grew up, I decided that I didn't really like Fogelberg's songwriting, though there's no denying his ability as a musician and singer. His songs were too obvious for me -- the sentiments were pretty, but there wasn't a lot of subtlety to his metaphors.<br /><br />But there was one of his songs I always kinda liked when I was a kid, though: \"Leader Of The Band\", about his father, who was a high school band director. I'll leave him with that.<br /><br /><em>The leader of the band is tired<br />And his eyes are growing old<br />But his blood runs through<br />My instrument<br />And his song is in my soul<br />My life has been a poor attempt<br />To imitate the man<br />I'm just a living legacy<br />To the leader of the band</em></p>",

And when they suddenly changed their mind, I said -- very explicitly -- that I believed we'd made a deal with the Turkish government. Specifically, I figured we'd told them once we'd gotten control of Iraq and the heat had died down a bit, we'd allow them to come in and take out the separatist Kurds in northern Iraq -- who had our back in both wars, incidentally. (I tried to find the blog post in question on archive.org, but I couldn't track it down. Damn those database failures.)<br /><br />Ahem.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20071216/ts_afp/turkeyunrestkurdsiraq\">Turkish planes bomb northern Iraq in hunt for PKK - Yahoo! News</a><br /><br /><blockquote>SULAIMANIYAH, Iraq (AFP) - Turkish planes bombed suspected rebel bases in northern Iraq on Sunday, killing one woman, damaging infrastructure and forcing villagers to flee, local officials said.<br /><br />Turkey's general staff said its warplanes had hit the \"regions of Zap, Hakurk and Avasin as well as the Qandil mountains\" -- known to harbour rear bases of the rebel Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).<br /><br />The Turkish military said the bombardment began at 1:00 am (2300 GMT Saturday) and all its aircraft had returned safely to base by 4:15 am (0215 GMT Sunday). Artillery continued to pound the targets once the planes left.<br /><br />The raids, <em>which Turkey's armed forces' chief said were carried out with US approval and intelligence</em>, were condemned by the Iraqi government, which called in the Turkish ambassador to explain his country's actions.</blockquote><br /><br />Italics mine.<br /><br />I found out some really interesting shit about US involvement in the whole PKK thing when I was in Turkey. I'm going to do some research and see if I can verify any of it.<br /><br />But it's nice to know I was totally right about this, even if nobody believed me or nobody really cares.</p>",

He played the Sioux leader Ten Bears, who befriends Costner's character.<br /><br />A respected musician, Westerman worked with Nelson, Bonnie Raitt, Harry Belafonte, Jackson Browne and others. His debut album, released in 1970, was titled <em>Custer Died For Your Sins</em>.

Volette is going to be <i>my</i> kind of travel blog, which means it's going to be weird and cool and will have, under no circumstances, anything written by earnest Australian backpacker types who haven't worn pants that reach their knees since the mid-90s. Screw those guys.<br /><br />We've already got some great work up by writers such as NME regular Paolo Hewitt (on <a href=\"http://www.volette.com/blog/?p=20\">the seductive streets of London's SoHo</a>) and Stine Bauer Dahlberg, our managing editor (who weighs in on <a href=\"http://www.volette.com/blog/?p=103\"><strike>Stockholm</strike> Oslo, Scandanavia's new \"capitol of cool\"</a>).<br /><br />And today, you can read Volette's first feature article: <a href=\"http://www.volette.com/blog/?page_id=152\">\"Istanbul: City Of Cats\"</a>, by yours truly. It's an account of my time in Istanbul a few weeks ago, a long piece, and -- I think -- one of the best pieces I've ever written.<br /><br />We'll be adding video and pics to the piece in the upcoming days, and there's a sequel coming very soon, about my trip to Cappadocia. This is a standalone piece, and I hope you really like it.<br /><br />If you do, please please please link to it. We'd like to appear somewhere in Google, so any linkage you can do from your site or blog will be much appreciated. We're a small outfit, and we need grassroots support.<br /><br />So go check it out, and let us know what you think!</p>",

It remains one of the keystone anthems of the American civil rights movement, and a deeply moving and beautiful song in its own right. <a href=\"http://www.songsofsamcooke.com/articles/marcuschange.htm\">This article by Greil Marcus pretty much sums it up</a>.<br /><br />[Edit: for some reason, my YouTube embed doesn't seem to be working. Go watch a video of the song <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3pVsPStaOI\">here</a>.]<br /><br />I wonder what Cooke would think if he were alive today -- how much of his change he would have actually seen in America.<br /><br /><i>I was born by the river in a little old tent<br />Oh, and just like that river, I've been runnin' ever since<br />It's been a long, a long time coming, but I know<br />A change is gonna come<br />Oh, yes it is<br /><br />It's been too hard living, but I'm afraid to die<br />'Cause I don't know what's up there beyond the sky<br />It's been a long, a long time coming, but I know<br />A change is gonna come<br /><br />I go to the movies and I go downtown<br />Somebody keeps telling me<br />\"Don't hang around\"<br />It's been a long, a long time coming, but I know<br />A change is gonna come<br /><br />Then I go to see my brother<br />And I say \"Brother, help me please\"<br />But he winds up knocking me<br />Back down on my knees<br /><br />There been times that I thought<br />I couldn't last for long<br />But somehow I'm able to carry on<br />It's been a long time, a long time coming<br />But I know a change is gonna come</i><br /><br />RIP, brother.</p>",

I don’t know what it was about his songs, but he’d have some songs, and things on the surface were normal or happy, he’d be singing about having a party, there’s cokes in the iceboxes or whatever, and everything’s glowy, but underneath, it’s like he’s talking about something else, the last party on earth. Something in his voice. I’d rather do something like that than some icy cold electronic music, to try and get a bit of that in it.</blockquote><br /><br />This caught my attention, because I feel the same way about the song he's talking about, \"Having A Party\". It's happy on the surface, but there's a deep sadness in it, as well. Maybe it's just the melody/chord progression. I always try to capture that same thing, to various degrees.<br /><br />Burial's newest album, <i>Untrue</i>, is pretty amazing. You should track it down, if you like electronic music.</p>",

                "content": "<p>In an essay for the <i>Guardian</i> UK, writer Ronan Bennett <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/race/story/0,,2213223,00.html\">takes novelist Martin Amis to task for his alleged racism towards Muslims</a>.<br /><br /><blockquote>We can dispense with Amis's polite fiction that he is talking about \"Islamism\"; there are just too many generalisations (\"The impulse towards rational inquiry,\" Amis wrote elsewhere, \"is by now very weak in the rank and file of the Muslim male\"), too many references to \"them\" and \"us\". When he says, for example, \"they\" are gaining on \"us\" demographically, he is demonstrably not talking about \"Islamists\". The danger of being overrun, outnumbered, outbred is a repugnant trope beloved of supremacists everywhere (it was used by the Evening Standard about \"aliens\" 100 years ago). It is, for example, horribly familiar to Arab Israelis, and to Irish Catholics (from whom Eagleton is descended). When Amis voices his fears of being overrun, he is, and he knows he is, perpetuating and enhancing the spectre of the other, and loading it with the potent imagery of swarming poverty, violence and ignorance.</blockquote><br /><br />I haven't read Amis's particular remarks here, so I can't comment on them, but I have seen him behave like an ass in print before, and very little he says would surprise me.<br /><br />However, there's a far more interesting point here: <i>is</i> criticizing Islam racist? I don't think so. Bennett himself disagrees, saying this:<br /><br /><blockquote>Those who claim that Islamophobia can't be racist, because Islam is a religion not a race, are fooling themselves: religion is not only about faith but also about identity, background and culture, and Muslims are overwhelmingly non-white. Islamophobia is racist, and so is antisemitism.</blockquote><br /><br />But a few paragraphs down he talks about the \"sheer variety of belief\" and \"cultural diversity\" within Islam.<br /><br />I think the Muslim faith is generally infantile and dangerous. But I also feel that way about Christianity and Judaism. (I tend to look more kindly upon Hindus and Buddhists...not because I think their beliefs are any less stupid, but because they seem to be far more <i>lassaiz faire</i> than the Big Three in the West. There's nothing, so far as I know, in Hindu or Buddhist faith about killing or converting infidels. So they're definitely a lot less dangerous.) I do think that Amis's statement that rational inquiry is short on the ground in the Muslim population is probably true...but the same can be said of fundamentalist Christians or orthodox Jews.<br /><br />On the other hand...well, I can't remember the last time the Pope issued a death edict to anybody for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_Rushdie#The_Satanic_Verses_and_the_fatwa\">suggesting that Christ may have been making it all up</a>, or that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_controversy\">Jews rioted violently over cartoons mocking Moses</a>, or the last time <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/africa/11/30/sudan.bears/\">someone was arrested and threatened with serious beating and/or death for naming a teddy bear Jesus</a>. Despite the excesses of Mossad, Jews are not particularly known for suicide bombing.<br /><br />Is it some sort of Western cultural imperialism to suggest that killing people for disagreeing with or disregarding your faith is pretty goddamn barbaric? That <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=452288&in_page_id=1811\">stoning women to death for perceived misbehavior</a> -- another act that happens at least a few times a year in Islamic communities, and not so much in Christian or Judaic communities -- is something other than merely a different cultural norm?<br /><br />And if the Islamic community in general is really so outraged and scandalized by these lunatic behaviors, why do those who commit them generally go unpunished either in secular or religious courts?<br /><br />I do not believe this has anything to do with any particular ethnic groups within the Islamic diaspora at large. For many centuries, Arabic culture was far more rational and refined than European culture, by anybody's standards, for example. I don't even think that intolerance, barbarism and misogyny are indelible signifiers of Islam itself. And I believe that there is much of philosophical and sociocultural value to be found in the Qu'ran, as there is in the Bible and the Talmud and the Bhaghavad-Gita, even if you do not choose to join the faiths associated with these works.<br /><br />But it's hard to argue that, out of the three belief systems that dominate in the West, Islam does seem to produce the most violence both within and without its ranks.<br /><br />I don't think this means Islam should be suppressed (or at least, suppressed any more than any other religion), or that Muslims ought to be persecuted. People have a right to their beliefs, no matter how goofy.<br /><br />But I do think that the Islamic community at large might want to think about reconsidering the tolerance with which it handles the more lunatic fringe within itself. Or hire some better PR people.<br /><br />Of course, you could say the same thing of Martin Amis.</p>",

I sat for two hours and talked and ate caviar with a young Russian couple and a middle-aged British couple, and lost (twice) armwrestling to Lenny, the Russian guy. (I've never had orange caviar. Tastes like sushi.)<br /><br />Then I found my way to the Terrace Guesthouse, which is a perfectly gorgeous little hotel not three blocks from the Hagia Sophia, and extremely reasonably priced...particularly since I can stand on my balcony and look out across the Bosporus, which is the channel that divides Europe from Asia.<br /><br />Western Union is not open on Sundays, so I'll leave tomorrow for Göreme, where I plan to stay in Cappadocia. This afternoon is just relaxation and a tiny bit of cheap trinket shopping (evil eyes for everyone!)<br /><br />I am extremely happy, in a way I haven't been extremely happy in a long time.</p>",

So I'm not up to much here tonight -- Joe and I went shopping and met up with the lovely Ginger Wang (a friend and colleague of ours). Joe gave me his old Nokia e61i phone, which I used to take that picture, and we also picked up a Bluetooth GPS unit to go with it -- I'm gonna try and figure out if I can download maps to it, and -- failing that -- if I can use the Nokia GPS with the Macbook. I really like this Nokia on short notice -- it's got wifi capability, so I can use it even without a SIM card. It's got the weird German QWERTZ keyboard though, which is kinda funny.<br /><br />And I had <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B0skender_kebap\">Iskender kebab</a> in a Turkish restaurant, which made me immensely happy. It's colder than hell here, easily fifty degrees (Fahrenheit, thank you, Vanessa) colder than Vegas. But I love it. I like Frankfurt more and more every time I come here. It's not as cool as Berlin, but it's still an interesting city.<br /><br /><a href='http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/111720070021.jpg' title='11172007002.jpg'><img src='http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/111720070021-150x150.jpg' alt='11172007002.jpg' /></a><br /><br />Off to take a hot goddamn shower.

                "content": "<p>Unnerving experience this morning.<br /><br />I spent all night at Starbucks, redesigning Zenarchery, and headed for the bus stop (and home) around 6:30 am. The 24 hour Starbucks I go to is at the corner of Flamingo and Paradise, and the bus stop is a half-block east on Flamingo, directly in front of Terrible's Casino. (You can see exactly where I was <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&time=&date=&ttype=&q=flamingo+and+paradise+las+vegas,+nv&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=39.916234,99.84375&ie=UTF8&ll=36.118568,-115.153971&spn=0.009967,0.024376&z=16&om=0&layer=c&cbll=36.114318,-115.153334&cbp=1,565.276157023875,,0,-1.7039330156853003\">here</a>, courtesy of Google Maps.)<br /><br />As I approached the Terrible's sign, I noticed something white and red lying on the grass. As I got closer, I saw what it was: a dress shirt, crumpled on the grass, and absolutely covered with fresh blood. I was so tired, I took a picture of it, thinking it was just odd...and then I realized what I was actually looking at, and what it implied.<br /><br /><img src='http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/sspx00471.jpg' alt='Bloody shirt' /><br /><br />Another man was walking up with a Terrible's custodian -- he had noticed it and had brought the custodian to throw it away. The man walked off and I told the custodian \"Dude, you might want to call Metro. That didn't come from a nosebleed or anything.\"<br /><br />He went to get his supervisor and I waited. When the supervisor got there, I told him the same thing -- the amount of blood on the shirt suggested that somebody got hurt, bad. He tried to play it off -- \"Maybe somebody fell down drunk and cracked their head\" -- but he obviously didn't believe it, and neither did I.<br /><br />Finally, he just had the first guy throw it away, using latex gloves. (\"And throw the gloves away, too, when you're done.\") As he picked it up, I could see that there were several spots where the blood hadn't even begun to dry -- it was shiny and moist.<br /><br />So I called Metro's non-emergency line myself as I waited for the bus. I explained the situation, but the operator told me there wasn't much they could do about it, unless they had a stabbing in the area. \"Well, if you <i>do</i> discover a stabbing in the area, check the trash at Terrible's,\" I told her. And that was that.<br /><br />But I thought about it on the bus ride home. There was a <i>lot</i> of blood. And it wasn't droplet blood, like it would be from a scalp wound or even a heavy nosebleed. There wasn't a drip pattern, or a spatter pattern. It was <i>sprayed</i>. It looked like somebody cut somebody else's artery and got hit with the spray. And the blood was bright red, like fresh arterial blood. (It <i>was</i> blood, by the way, not paint or some foodstuff. I know what fresh blood looks like. It was too thick to be cranberry juice or anything like that.)<br /><br />I think somebody fucked somebody else up really bad and then ditched their shirt, either on foot or throwing it from a car window. It wasn't an expensive shirt, but I noticed that it had metal snap buttons, not push-through buttons like you'd normally see. I'd guess it was about a medium or a small, though I never saw it stretched out.<br /><br />I guess we'll never know. Metro wasn't interested, neither were the Terrible's custodians. But I think somebody out there is dead or hurt real bad.<br /><br />Welcome to Vegas.</p>",

Anderson</a>, whom you probably know as either the backwards-talking dwarf from <i>Twin Peaks</i> or Samson from HBO's series <i>Carnivale</i>. I recognized him immediately -- he's pretty striking, as he's extremely short, and he doesn't have the sort of general similarities to his features that many little people have (because he doesn't actually have dwarfism, but another bone disorder).<br /><br />He was just driving a blue car. He drove by really slow, pulled up to the laundromat, paused for about thirty seconds, and then drove away. I have no idea what he was doing. But I made eye contact with him, and it was definitely Michael J. Anderson, unless there's another dude of that general age, height and appearance wandering around America, which I find rather unlikely.</p>",

(There's no such thing as digital Cheez-Whiz. That's my point. Think about it.) They've got a lot to recommend them to First World consumers as well as Third World students, they're hackable as all hell, and they're cheap: $399 buys one for you and one for a kid in the Third World.<br /><br />As a portable gadget, I'd say they're probably superior to the new <a href=\"http://eeepc.asus.com/en/\">Asus EEE</a>, which runs around the same price. I'd really recommend getting one, if you can afford it, as a laptop alternative, and as karma insurance. Hell, you might find yourself using your XO more than your regular laptop, particularly for e-book reading.<br /><br />And if anybody wants to buy me one, I won't argue. This is one of the only pieces of hardware I'm genuinely lusting over right now. I'd rather have an XO than an iPhone, if that gives you any idea.</p>",

It's all big drumlines and shuffling, almost Johnny Cash-esque acoustic guitar and layered vocals. No bass yet -- I need to figure out what I'm going to do there. I think probably extremely simple, long notes, rather than anything too showy. And I need to add some organ and maybe an accordion.<br /><br />It's so goddamn pretty, though. Hopeful and beautiful and faster than the demo. It's closest to the kind of thing I really want to do, a kind of numinous, transcendent music that's savage without being hardcore. It doesn't sound electronic and it doesn't sound acoustic -- I don't know what it sounds like, really -- but I really like it.<br /><br />Also finally chords for the Vegas song I came up with in the car driving back from LA a year or so ago. It might be the last song on the album -- it's a short, slow piano song about this city and the hideous fuckers who come here to party and behave like assholes. Yes, you, dude.

I then separated out twenty of the most interesting shapes, brought them into Flash and made them movie clips, and then made outline versions of each one.<br /><br />The Actionscript randomly places the forms around the canvas. This has several thousand iterations -- I let it run at 60 frames per second for roughly fifteen minutes. I then saved it as a PostScript file, brought it into Illustrator, and did some cleanup. This is a very small version of an extremely detailed larger render.<br /><br />I think this is very beautiful.

It was, in my opinion, the best alternative culture magazine that America ever had. They wrote about smart drugs, brain implants, virtual reality, cyberpunk, Cthulhupunk and cryogenics. They covered Laibach and Lydia Lunch in the same issue. The pantheon of writers was a force to be reckoned with: Bruce Sterling, Robert Anton Wilson, and William Gibson all lent their talents, and there was even a Burroughs vs. Leary interview face-off. Then there was the famous U2-Negativland interview, in which Negativland, disguised as reporters, interviewed U2 into a corner to reveal the band’s hypocrisy over their lawsuit against Negativland over sampling. All in all, the magazine took risks. “The good dream for me and Mondo,” said editor R.U. Sirius in an interview with Purple Prose, “is overcoming the limits of biology without necessarily leaving sensuality or sexuality behind.” Issue after issue, <em>Mondo 2000</em> threw a sexy dystopian bash and invited the decade’s best thinkers.</blockquote><br /><br />Including me, heh heh.

                "content": "<p>Hi, America. Josh Ellis here.<br /><br />So I've been noticing, for the past couple of years, a rising backlash against the current presidential administration. I hear a lot of you talking, wide-eyed and horrified, about Bush's lies and the excesses of the NSA and Gonzalez's Justice Department, the stupidity of the war...you know what you're all so shocked about, so I'm not going to make a laundry list. You're outraged by all of this. You want answers.<br /><br />What none of you seem to want to do is to shut the fuck up and take it good and hard.<br /><br />You see, you have absolutely no right to outrage. You have no right to point fingers at anyone. You really, in fact, have no right to complain at all. Because this is all <i>your fault</i>.<br />All those lies you were told? Feeble, silly lies, told by patently untrustworthy people who could barely keep a straight face during press conferences. No one with any sense would have believed them. I didn't believe them, ever. None of the smart people I know believed them, because they were such blatant fabrications that a small child could have easily seen through them.<br /><br />My fellow Americans, most of you are now demonstrably less canny and intelligent than a small child.<br /><br />The war in Iraq? Your fault. Your dead children husbands and wives and brothers and sisters? Your fault. You are guilty of filicide, fratricide, and homicide beyond imagining. Every single American man and woman who died in the dirt and shit and sand of Baghdad and Fallujah and Tikrit? Their death is specifically <i>your fault</i>. You believed those pathetic lies, you hid your ignorance in the cheap cloak of patriotism. You stood by and did nothing while our military -- <i>your</i> military -- disgraced themselves and us with torture and rape and unjustified murder. You are widowmakers, orphanmakers, you create terrorists by the thousands because you sent your children and husbands and wives and brothers and sisters to a place where they cannot discern between friends and enemies. Those new terrorists, those suicide bombers and jihadists who hate you so much? Their hatred is justified. You see, you killed their children and husbands and wives and brothers and sisters, their parents and teachers and friends. You did it. Not Bush, not Rumsfeld or Petraeus. You did it.<br /><br />You treat our friends and neighbors with xenophobia, paranoia, hostility and contempt. And then you whine like sick dogs because you are hated everywhere in the world. They, too, are right to hate you. You are spineless bullies, disgusting little thugs who hide behind the big gun of the American military and dare anyone to look at you funny.<br /><br />This is <i>your fault</i>. I cannot say that enough.<br /><br />9/11 was a tragedy, but it was not the first tragedy, and not the last, and not even the worst. It certainly was not an excuse to collectively wipe our asses with the Constitution. And that's precisely what we've done, by removing the foundations of the First and Fourth Amendments, just as a beginning. You may not know or believe that, but what you know and what you believe is pretty much irrelevant at this point.<br /><br />You know nothing. You believe what you're told.<br /><br />In fact, that may be the new defining characteristic of the 21st American: you do what you're told. You do what you're told because you refuse to think for yourself or make any decision beyond which reality TV show you're going to watch tonight and which one you're going to TiVo. You buy what you're told to buy, you vote for the candidate who seems most like you (meaning oblivious, borderline imbecilic and totally unwilling to accept responsibility for his actions). You don't want to hear when people who -- unlike you -- actually <i>pay fucking attention</i> to the world around them try to tell you that you're being used and lied to.<br /><br />We've been telling you for the past six years that you're destroying your own country. You. Not them. Because you want freedom and you want democracy, so you live in a nation of elected officials. You picked these people. You should have known what they were. We did. We told you. You picked them anyway.<br /><br />So quit whining. Quit complaining. Quit trying to find somebody -- anybody -- to blame. Because <i>this is all your fault</i>. And you deserve what you've gotten.<br /><br />It doesn't matter who you vote for this time. The Democrats are spineless and the Republicans are all small, crazy men. The damage has been done. And you did it.<br /><br />Do me a favor. <i>Don't vote.</i> You don't deserve it, even if advertising tells you you're a smart, beautiful, unique snowflake. You're actually kind of a retard. So stay the fuck out of politics and let those of us who can find our own country on a goddamn map make the decisions for a while, you chimpy little bastards.<br /><br />Am I upsetting you? Good. I hate you. You suck. Your sense of entitlement and your unwillingness to accept the consequence of your (non-) choices makes me physically ill. Let me reiterate that: when I think about you dribbling fuckmonkeys rolling into the polling booths in your little Electric Weasel scooters, I pray for Armageddon. If there is a God, His most holy purpose will be to rid the world of people like you.<br /><br />So sit down in front of your TV, put on <i>The Flavor Of Love</i> reruns, shut up, do what you're told, and stop lying to yourself: you've destroyed America. You. Nobody but you. Enjoy the world you've made.<br /><br />And enjoy your show.</p>",

It's from Bryan Fuller, who did <i>Dead Like Me</i>, which used to be my favorite show, until it got cancelled.<br /><br />It's about a guy who can quite inexplicably make dead people come alive again. But if he touches them again, they die; and if he <i>doesn't</i> touch them again within a minute of bringing them back, someone else nearby will die. He and his partners -- a detective with a compulsive knitting habit and his formerly-dead childhood sweetheart, whom he loves but cannot touch -- solve murders by resurrecting victims and, well, asking them who killed them.<br /><br />This is plot. What makes it magic is that it's shot and structured a whole lot like <i>Amelie</i> (complete with omniscient narrator) and written like a cross between a Tom Stoppard play (complete with absurdist dialogue) and Neil Gaiman's <i>Sandman</i> (complete with incredible intelligence and extremely funny grim humor). I guess it reminds me a lot of Lemony Snicket as well.<br /><br />Also, I am officially in love with Anna Friel, who plays Chuck, the undead childhood sweetheart.<br /><br />Seriously, go check it out. It's worth your time. Help me not get it cancelled so I have something to watch.</p>",

Passing the measure would not automatically mean Turkish troops going into northern Iraq.<br /><br />Political analysts say a major military operation remains unlikely, given opposition from the United States, Turkey's NATO ally, but Erdogan is under pressure to act tough after a series of deadly rebel attacks on Turkish security forces.</blockquote></p>",

And most of us got the evolution thing about a century and a half ago. If you can't keep up with the class, don't raise your hand, okay?<br /><br />Look, I can barely -- <i>barely</i>, mind you -- understand how people can be ignorant of how evolution works. To a point. I've gone through the American educational system, so I see how that can work.<br /><br />But to be totally unaware of the fact that <i>you live on a spherical planet</i> -- which is the sort of thing you're taught at the age of roughly five years old in every school in every country on this planet -- and to be so cheerfully, blissfully stupid that you're not ashamed of <i>announcing it on international television</i> -- is the most idiotic thing I think I've ever encountered. Seriously. I have absolutely no sympathy for this stupid, stupid woman. I'm surprised she's capable of forming semi-coherent sentences, or using a toilet without a high degree of frustration and mindless rage.<br /><br />And when she goes on TV tomorrow and tries to play it off, <i>don't let her</i>. When someone asks you if the world is round or flat, you say \"round\". Period. There is no other answer. (\"Imperfectly spherical with a high degree of fractal roughness\" is also a correct answer, but nobody likes a math geek, Scully.) Giving any other answer -- or even <i>hesitating for a second to think about it</i> -- means that you should probably be kept away from the general populace and sharp objects, because you are an imbecile.<br /><br />There is no excuse for this, except absolute, astonishing stupidity. ABC has completely and utterly discredited itself by beaming this slack-jawed cretin and her babbling around the world. If they had even the slightest bit of sense or dignity, they'd have her flung into the street so that the entire species could surround her and laugh at her until she shat herself and stumbled away into obscurity, crying like a retarded child who just broke their favorite toy.<br /><br />Fuck her. Fuck <i>The View</i>. And fuck ABC.<br /><br />I'm going to go read a book and feel superior.</p>",

Which makes sense to me, as covering up such a thing (or at least stubbornly denying the whole thing) seems more in line with trad U.S. military policy.<br /><br />Hell, I wonder if there were actually any nukes at all. From what I understand, \"accidentally\" loading nuclear missiles onto a plane is a fairly difficult mistake to make.</p>",

So we'll re-record that bit, along with a bit for the chorus that's in the same vein, and I think we'll be done with the guitar for that song. At some point, I'm gonna throw an ARP 2600 line into it at the sixteen-bar break, because I think it's cooler to have an arpeggiated synth line (maybe run through a wah and chopped around) than a guitar solo.<br /><br />Thom's playing most of the guitar on this one -- we're just recording it at his apartment, amped and miked. Apparently it doesn't bother his neighbors.<br /><br />Side note: one of the fun things about getting together to play is pulling tracks out of the iPod and going \"Like, hear how that guitar line goes? All angular? Like <i>that</i>.\" Tonight we listened to Bloc Party's \"Banquet\" and Talking Heads' \"Houses In Motion\" -- if you know those songs you might be able to imagine what \"Entropy\" is starting to sound like. But not really. Heh.<br /><br />Best moment: in the car on the way to his apartment, Thom and I were talking about recognizing sources of samples. He put on an extremely obscure album of African chant...and I was totally delighted to recognize the background of Nine Inch Nails' \"Head Like A Hole\", and to realize that what I always though was some sort of percussive synth was actually some African dude going \"Huh! Huh! Hah!\".<br /><br /><i>Where were you when the world was made?<br />I was still drunk from the night before<br />I heard the sound of the Big Bang<br />And I staggered to the door<br />I saw the whole of Creation<br />I saw the master plan<br />We made kings of monkeys<br />When we put the thumbs on their hands</i><br /><br />(Edit: Hell, I made this sample for Thom, so I'll throw it up here: <a href='http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/entropy_snippet.mp3' title='Entropy Snippet'>MP3 snippet of \"Entropy\", unfinished</a>.</p>",

Sweet rampant returning Messiah, I am absolutely fucked to the gills. I spent five minutes staring at the print of Munch's <i>The Scream</i> that we keep on our bathroom wall (apparently as some sort of gastrointestinal inspiration). The goddamned electric blue highlights kept popping out at me.</p><br /><br /><p>Stereolab is playing on the surround sound system and I am feeling terribly Pop right now -- probably not least of all because I've been reading my favorite issue of Grant Morrison's <i>The Invisibles</i>, \"And We Are All Policemen\". Somewhere in this blog I once quoted that issue -- \"Pop, like Chronos the Titan, always eats its' own darlings.\"</p><br /><br /><p>Goddamned right. <a href=\"http://www.barbelith.com/bomb/char_king.htm\">King Mob</a> is <a href=\"http://www.4w8w.com/bookmoorcock2.html\">Jerry Cornelius</a> and so am I. I am a Dangerous Subversive, goddamnit. I am a refugee of the <a href=\"http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/terrorists/meinhof/1.html\">Prada-Meinhof</a> generation.

Actually, anything is acceptable so long as it is Eurotrash.</p><br /><br /><p>I am a Furniture Terrorist! I bring the dangerous ideas of Scandanavian industrial designers into this country via <a href=\"http://www.wallpaper.com/\">revolutionary samizdat</a> and spread them to the unwashed masses of lumpenWalMartariats who cringe in their upholstered deck chairs and look in wonder upon my Chic! Republican girls want to slather my penis with their unholy corrosive saliva!

If that little M. Butterfly motherfucker <a href=\"http://www.williamhung.net/\">William Hung</a> can get the Bling-Bling tossed at him by a nation grateful for his witless crooning, why not Dr. Ellis? Why not, indeed!</p><br /><br /><p>The world <i>needs</i> a baritone right now. This is a baritonic millenium! Not the fey sopranos of <a href=\"http://www.sigur-ros.com/\">Icelandic sissy-boys</a> for <i>this</i> era, nossir! Men! With balls!

Brian Wilson can smiley-smile on my beautiful <i>lingam</i>.)</p><br /><br /><p>Christ, my skull is soaring and my stomach is swooping and these goddamned French women are babbling at me in their heathen tongue over extremely sociopathic Moog disco. Why have I chosen this terrible music? It's the sound of a Charles de Gaulle airport lounge in 2015 if the Nazis had won and taken over all those years ago. \"Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere,\" they are singing in between their horrible Gallic ravings...somewhere, <a href=\"http://www.geektimes.com/michael/culture/reality/merhan-nasseri/stranded.html\">Merhan Nasseri</a> is hiding under a plastic lounge chair in a frenzy, surrounded by Freedom Fries from the departure terminal's McDonalds and praying to Allah in frenzied Farsi. Or Iranian. Or whatever the fuck it is he speaks.</p><br /><br /><p>Have I ever told you, my interglobal audience, of my uncontrollable desire during the mid to late 1990s to bang the holy ass off of <a href=\"http://www.northern-star.co.uk/\">Sporty Spice</a>? I'm talking full on Mickey Rourke sex here, in some anonymous Third World five star hotel where all the furnishings are covered in cheap brown wood Con-Tact paper and the waiters all wear black gloves. Me and Mel C, under the orange paisley sheets, feeding each other lox and opium bagels off of one another's shaved genitalia...her moans as I trace the lines of her track pants with my tongue before removing them with a straight razor...the horrified whispers of her fellow Spiceians when she returns from her sojourn in Addis Ababa with a triply-pierced <a href=\"http://www.kheper.net/topics/chakras/Perineum.htm\">perineum</a> and a sudden devotion to the more baroque practices of Sufism...my absolute refusal to speak of her in interviews, only looking fondly out the window and playing Leonard Cohen's <a href=\"http://www.leonardcohen.com/lc06_10.html\">\"Chelsea Hotel No. 2\"</a> on a boombox whenever the subject is mentioned.... Melanie, I still haven't forgotten you, though Blighty and the scattered remnants of Empire might have. I love my girlfriend but you are ever in my thoughts, <i>mein liebchen</i>.</p><br /><br /><p>I never fancied any of the other Spice Girls, though Geri Halliwell looked like she might be good for a tumble or two -- the Baby one was far too Roman Polanski, the Scary one was just too unthreatening and the...who's the other one, still famous but now for no apparent reason, married some homosexual rugby player or something...she was just...ugh. Looked like all the girls I used to sport-fuck in high school. Student Council types who were all stuck up until you got their panties off, at which point they turned into total skanks, as it should be. </p><br /><br /><p>Christ. Too many horrible perverted thoughts in high school. It was that horrible Trent Reznor that did it -- all those nights sitting around in my trailer in the snows of Montana, listening to \"<a href=\"http://www.lyricsondemand.com/n/nineinchnailslyrics/theonlytimelyrics.html\">The Only Time</a>\" over and over and jacking off furiously, wishing I could tap the ass of one of the local alterna-rock girls, though I never did. (I'd name names, believe me, but you wouldn't give a mad fuck and more to the point I'm terrified that they read the Interweb, and that I'd subject them to the vision of the 14 year old me, chubby and half my head shaven, my bleach-spattered Bugle Boy overalls around my ankles as I sweatily wanked into sweet oblivion with their pimply adolescent faces scrawled across my <i>corpus callosum</i>, writhing in utterly imaginary yet semi-realistic ecstasy at my very touch. Shit, you know who you are, take it as a compliment and move on with your life. You'll never have better at any rate, and you never even got to touch me.)</p><br /><br /><p>The French women are stimulating me unnecessarily. Must switch music. Over to iTunes....</p><br /><br /><p>Shit! Almost clicked over to John Lee Hooker, at which point I would have had to have moved to New Orleans and had sex with half the Goth population immediately, including the literary ones. Luckily I managed to get on the Jesus and Mary Chain's <i>Psychocandy</i> in time. This still reminds me of early 90s alterna-chick-sex, though.</p><br /><br /><p>But then again, what doesn't, these days? Those were heady times for those of us who were 13 and 14 when Nirvana came out. I was just hip enough to see Nirvana as the rising crest of a tide I'd already caught, with the Pixies and the Femmes and the Lemonheads and Concrete Blonde and Nine Inch Nails. Back then, all the girls had purple hair and black fingernails and would dance around lazily in the basements of their parents' houses to \"<a href=\"http://www.guntheranderson.com/v/data/bloodlet.htm\">Bloodletting</a>\" while the rest of us smoked pot and talked about how fucking intricate H.R. Giger's paintings were and how cool Robert Anton Wilson was. And I was 14, folks. I was fucking <i>hep</i>, lemme tell you.</p><br /><br /><p>But those days are long gone; alterna-Pop has been Balkanized, and none of you remember it or give a fuck about it anyway, those dead days when all we wanted was to fuck Juliana Hatfield and work as an A&R geek for SubPop. You love your Britney and your Justin and your masturbatory pop icons.</p><br /><br /><p>All I ever wanted was to be <a href=\"http://davekendall.com/\">Dave Kendall</a>. I wanted to be the sleek-headed Eurotrash guy who got to hang out with the rock stars. I spent a few years doing that in the 1990s, and you know what? Rock stars are <a href=\"http://www.robertcrosbie.com/evandando/\">dicks</a>. They have an overinflated sense of self-worth which is as totally undeserved in their cases as it is justly deserved in mine.</p><br /><br /><p>So Evan Dando actually did get to fuck Juliana Hatfield, so what? He was a prick to me at a big Almost-Acoustic Christmas show in San Jose in '96, and nobody remembered who he was but me, anyway. The audience was there for Lou Barlow, who totally replaced Evan as Alternahunk of the Decade, and the only person who sang along with \"It's A Shame About Ray\" was my sorry ass, sitting in the press area with my <i>Mondo 2000</i> credentials and my memories -- only a few years old then -- of sitting around in my friend Sarah's laundry room with my friends Nate Varnum and Jeremy Snyder, tentatively playing that self-same song on my mom's acoustic guitar and wishing I could be Evan Dando. He got to fuck Juliana Hatfield (while vehemently denying it all the while) and hang out with Johnny Depp and be on the cover of cool magazines, and I was some dorky fat kid living in Hamilton, Montana. The least the motherfucker could have been was gracious when I went backstage to tell him thanks.</p><br /><br /><p>Of course now he's off milking his blood for heroin remnants in Australia or something and I'm here, tripping my balls off and babbling at you with my PowerBook while the Reid brothers yell over my surround sound system. My drugs are better, Evan, the sun is good and truly risen, and I'd like to think I've gotten it out of my system...but I haven't really and, God willing, I never will. I have replaced Evan Dando and Lou Barlow as the Counterculture Sexy Boy of this coming aeon, and I will rise to my ascendancy on a wave of mutilation. Wa-a-a-a-ave. W-a-a-a-ave.</p><br /><br /><p>I am a deranged cocksucker and plan to be until the Man finally kicks the door down and comes to haul me away...at which point I will <i>laugh</i> at him and demand to see his papers. For I am nothing if not thorough.</p><br /><br /><p>Good morning to you all.</p></p>",

They'd fuck her/her in the ass just like the others did, only they'd listen to T-Rex on vinyl and think themselves macho.<br /><br />The guys in the lab learned how to get blackly drunk very quickly. They'd stumble in after they'd been thrown out of a dozen casinos and call us monsters, using their research as some cheap toy. We would invariably beat the piss out of them and leave them down on the beaches for the heroin dealers to find when they brought in their fresh shipments every morning right before dawn.<br /><br />For me, she was smooth. Nothing. A translucent membrane, opening to the Mediterranean breeze. You could see things moving around inside of her, and when she orgasmed she would light up internally like the phosphorescent algae on the rocks below, and her surfaces would arch and spindle improbably like Hilbert space.<br /><br />And now I live inside her, and look out through these crystal walls at the blue sky and the azure ocean. I can taste the pheremones in the air like sizzling fire, and I know what love is.<br /><br /><i>(Dedicated to Lou and Evan and all the kids at Cody High.

                "content": "<p>My friend <a href=\"http://www.michaelbernstein.com\">Mike Bernstein</a> emailed me to tell me that big chunks of the ZA archives are available on <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/*sa_/http://zenarchery.wpengine.com/\">Archive.org</a>. While hunting around, I discovered this entry from October 8, 2003.<br /><br />I <i>told</i> you I was ahead of the game on multitouch systems.<br /><br /><blockquote>Which reminds me of a question I've been wanting to ask for a while: does anybody know if there are any OSes or GUIs out there that recognize multiple pointing devices? Because I really want to try out some ideas I've had that would utilize such a system.<br /><br />I'm not talking about simply hooking up two different mice here; that's essentially what the Wacom does (pen and mouse). I'm talking about having two different cursors, each one controlled by a different mouse.<br /><br />Obviously this has vast gaming potential; most 3DFPS games allow you to control your weapon targeting with the mouse and your movement with the keyboard. But that's not what I have in mind.<br /><br />Imagine, for example, a modified pen tablet, where instead of holding a pen, you wear a fingertip. You have two of these, one for each hand, one on each side of your keyboard.<br /><br />Instead of selecting text line by line, you simply put one finger at the top left corner of the text you want to select and the other finger at the bottom right. Or, if you have multiple pages to select (as I often do), one finger holds down the selection and the other scrolls.<br /><br />Or you're surfing the web. One finger does all the clicking, the other does all the navigation (scrolling, backwards and forwards through history, etc.) through gesture-based interaction. You don't have to worry about holding down command keys or anything else -- one hand interacts with the text, the other interacts with the chrome, in much the same way that speedreaders use one finger to scan the text and the other hand to turn the pages.<br /><br />One incredibly useful application of this tech would be to denote connections between onscreen data. For example: using an app like DENIM, you could throw up a flowchart and begin drawing links immediately and much more easily than you can with a keyboard and mouse.<br /><br />In point of fact, a two-handed interaction system like the one I'm describing would effectively replace the keyboard for 90% of computing applications. People are much better at two-finger typing than they are at thumb typing; imagine if, when you had a text input, a small Key Caps-style keyboard popped up at the bottom of the screen and you two-finger-typed your URL or filename or whatever. You'd only really use the keyboard when you needed to input long strings of text...if you were a touch typist, that is, or a half-assed hybrid like me (I use my left index finger and pinkie, my first three right fingers and my thumb to type, and I can do about fifty words a minute, sometimes more).<br /><br />I can think of a thousand uses for this. Apparently, so can academics. Of course, like most academic research, there's nothing that seems to actually be downloadable or useful.<br /><br />There seems to be a driver for Windows 98, but that's it. The only functional stuff I've found while Googling this subject are some C code samples and a few of demo executables for old versions of Windows. Nothing, in other words, that's ready for prime time.<br /><br />I don't know enough about compiled coding or GUI programming to even think about fucking with this stuff, but I can make a few educated guesses:<br /><br />    * The hardware aspect is trivial. I suspect this because if I plug two mice into my Mac, they'll both work at the same time (albeit interfering with one another). I seem to remember that the same thing is true of Windows XP. So the problem would be isolating the input from each USB device.<br />    * You'd have to work around the stupidity of the GUI coders...which means that your best bet would be to work in X-Windows, since you have access to the code. Identifying the mouse drivers in X-Windows and modding them would probably be easier than trying to do the same thing in MS-Windows. I'm not saying easy, I'm saying easier.<br />    * Your main problem would be adding another cursor. I would think that most apps (not including those, like graphics apps, which actively react to cursor location) wouldn't take a shit if you had multiple cursors clicking. All they recognize is that something has been clicked.<br />    * Having said this, you'd probably want to write some new apps that take real advantage of the possibilities of multi-input interaction.<br /><br />I don't know. Programming is hard. But do this, future entrepreneur, and I guarantee you'll have a hit on your hands (both of them).<br /><br />Just give me credit for thinking it up. Not money, mind you, just credit. And a free unit.</blockquote><br /><br />I am Future Boy, predicter of novelty interfaces.</p>",

It's relatively easy to make and a kick-ass addition to Mexican/Tex-Mex, Southern, or California fusion cuisine.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br />(Spices are approximate, YMMV)<br /><br />4 cans garbanzo beans<br />1 can kernel corn<br />1 can black beans<br />1/2 cup roasted red peppers or pimentos<br />2 tbsp cumin<br />2 tbsp red chili powder<br />1 tbsp garlic salt<br />1 tbsp cayenne pepper<br />1 tbsp black pepper<br />1/2 cup olive oil<br />2 1/2 cups flour<br /><br />DIRECTIONS<br /><br />Mash or puree garbanzo beans into a thick paste. Place in large bowl. Add 2 1/2 cups of flour (more or less, depending upon desired dryness -- more flour equals drier falafa-y'all). Stir until thoroughly mixed into an almost dough-like substance.<br /><br />Drain corn and black beans and pour into bowl. Chop red peppers into small pieces (or open and drain pimentos, which amounts to the same thing) and pour into bowl. Add olive oil and all seasonings. Fold with wooden spoon until mixture is complete.<br /><br />Form mixture into 1\" to 2\" balls and flatten slightly. At this point, you can either cook them in a skillet with 1/2\" of oil or deep fry them. Either way, cook until deep golden brown, remove from heat and drain oil on a plate with paper towels. Serve.<br /><br />Serves 5-10 people. You can also freeze the mixture or uncooked balls for later serving.</p>",

I've been hurt and hurt myself too much in the last few years.<br /><br />And the idea of sharing my life with anyone who would get in the way of the things I want to do is completely horrible to me.

                "content": "<p>So I'm in the Sprint Ambassador program, which means they send me phones a couple of times a year, with a free unlimited account to use them with. I like Sprint for this, even though I stopped paying my other phone bill out of brokeness and they've sent it to collections. (Dear Sprint: I swear I'll pay the bill as soon as I can.)<br /><br />The phone they've given me most recently is the titular Spring Samsung SPH-M610. I actually like it. It's not really a futurephone in any way, but it's a perfectly useful cellular phone with a decent built-in camera. I especially like the fact that it works as a Bluetooth-connected modem with my MacBook Pro, straight out of the box: just set it up in your Networking panel and it runs like butter. It's pretty fast, and it's been a lifesaver a couple of times.<br /><br />There are only two things, in fact, that I don't like about it: 1) the ringer isn't loud enough, and b) it uses a proprietary jack not only for power and USB, but also for wired headphone -- you can't just plug a 2.5mm headphone into it. Since I don't like my Bluetooth headphone very much, and I have a really nice wired headphone I use when driving or when I need my hands, this is sort of a problem.<br /><br />Other than that, I can actually recommend it as a low-end cellphone (as opposed to some multi-Benjamin rig like the iPhone or the Ocean or what-have-you). It's thin and light, with a rubberized skin that keeps it from slipping out of your hand (I've only dropped it once or twice, and it survived with no ill effects). The software is pretty straightforward and easy-to-use, though I wish there were an easier way to turn Bluetooth on and off than to go through a couple of menus. The battery life is good -- I usually need to charge it once every four or five days, unless I forget to turn the Bluetooth off after modem surfing, in which case it's about two to three days.<br /><br />I think I'll probably keep this phone until Sprint sends me a new one. After a few years, I got sick of my Treo 650. I never used the smartphone features, and it was just too big and bulky and fugly and useless as a modem (or even with a Bluetooth headset). Unless I get one of the new Samsungs like my friend Matt has -- which have dual QWERTY/keypad sliders -- I'm not going to bother with anything more hardcore. I just don't see the point, frankly...at least until cellphones and UMPCs finally just converge for good.</p>",

Most of the songs are newer; some I haven't finished recorded yet (\"The Big Darkness\", \"Scatterlings And Refugees\", \"Entropy\", \"After The Ice Age\"); there are a few older ones (\"Sleeping In Flame\", \"Sky Blue\", \"Redwood City Station\"). With only a couple of exceptions, I've decided to re-record everything again, because I finally feel like I know what I'm doing, for the most part.<br /><br />The album was going to be titled <i>The Big Darkness</i>, but on reflection I've decided to call it <i>Travelogue</i>, because that's basically what it is: all of the songs are about travel and exotic places and motion. The linchpin of the whole album is \"Scatterlings And Refugees\", which I just finished writing, and which may be the prettiest thing I've ever done. It's also the song that owes the most to Paul Simon, both in lyrics and melody. (Have I ever mentioned that <i>Graceland</i> and <i>The Rhythm Of The Saints</i> are two of my favorite albums of all time? I must have.)<br /><br />I started writing it for somebody I fell in love with; that didn't work out (or actually work at all, or even get hired to work in the first place), but the song is about the good feelings involved in that, not the sad feelings. It's a flat-out love song, a hopeful song, which is something rare for me -- especially since I've decided that I'm not going to open myself up to those feelings anymore. It never works out (or gets hired to work in the first place) and it's not worth getting the shit kicked out of me again.<br /><br />But hell, maybe the song will work for somebody else. :-)  That's the best you can hope for as a pop musician, I think: to write songs that make other people fall in love.<br /><br />I want to get this finished by the end of the year. Which, with my current roster of work projects, means I'm going to be invisible for the next few months. I've got a tentatively-scheduled work trip to Germany and Turkey in November (the details of which I'm not at liberty to talk about yet), and I may be spending a few weeks holed up in Nowheresville, Utah, also for work. I'm also hella broke, so I don't have a lot of money to spend on socializing.<br /><br />So don't expect to see me. But I'll post fragments of what I'm doing. And I'll leave you with a bit of \"Scatterlings\":<br /><br /><i>I rang the New Year in<br />In a field out in the suburbs somewhere outside East Berlin<br />I watched the fireworks burn the night<br />And I wondered where you were and if you were alright</i></p>",

It's a soundtrack for driving in the airport tunnel on Swenson here in Vegas in the middle of the night.

                "content": "<p>Reading <a href=\"http://blogs.citybeat.com/spill_it/2007/08/nothings-shocki.html#more\">Mike Breen's melancholy story about seeing Perry Farrell's new band, Satellite Party</a>, I was struck by this bit:<br /><br /><blockquote>There’s now a perception that the early ’90s “AltRock Revolution” was all dark and gloomy and doomy. But I remember a sense of hope. It was exciting to watch groups that I had seen play to 20 people at a tiny, dark, dank club months earlier suddenly get played on mainstream radio and dissected in the mainstream press. It was a weird feeling, but It felt like “something” was happening. But nothing ever really did. Pearl Jam gave up on their Ticketmaster fight. Kurt blew his head off. Cheesy Pop made a comeback. Mall stores started catering to the “Grunge” crowd. Peace never came, so the cynics just said, “See told you so” and put their headphones back on. The dream was over. Still is. Maybe that’s why hardly anyone was at the show.<br /><br />But we still need dreamers who don’t think about the end and the bottom line. We need more Perry Farrells. We need more young Perry Farrells. To evolve, we need people who think beyond themselves. </blockquote><br /><br />This is, I think, ultimately the problem I have with most rock 'n' roll right now. It's not <i>evolving</i>. The Strokes sounded like a slicker version of the New York Dolls; Interpol sounds like Joy Division; Modest Mouse sounds like the Pixies on Ritalin. (Are you really gonna argue this with me? Really?) And the kids love it. They love pop. They love disposable music. The sheer level of neoteny in rock and roll has reached a fever pitch: bands have a half life of no more than ten minutes before the kids wanna hear something new, new, new. How many new bands have the shelf life of, Christ, even a Pearl Jam these days? Of all of the new indie bands you're listening to, which ones do you think will put out a fourth album? A fifth? A fifteenth?<br /><br />I want to make this clear: I'm not waxing nostalgic for the old days. I don't think that expecting new musicians to push the envelope of what's been done before is some sort of old timer's position. Quite the opposite. I'm tired of nostalgia.<br /><br />Everybody draws on influences, sure; but there is a big difference between being influenced by an artist and doing a bad impersonation of them. A good artist -- in any medium -- synthesizes their influences, syncretizes them and adds something new and valuable to the mix.<br /><br />It's not that this can't be done. Radiohead did it a decade ago. Bjork's been doing it for almost twenty years now (more, if you add in her career with the Sugarcubes). The Decemberists are still trying to do it, and so is the Arcade Fire (though I'm not a huge fan of either band, and I'm not sure how well they succeed). I'm most impressed these days with artists who are working in the electronic and \"backpack\" hip-hop areas: the Klaxons, MIA, Hot Chip, The Roots, Aesop Rock, RJD2, Prefuse '73...these are artists who are taking a whole lot of different ideas and extending them.<br /><br />I think where I differ from most music-lovers is in my belief that music serves a purpose being making your booty shake. Popular music, to me, is one of the driving forces of culture. I won't go so far as to suggest that pop musicians have a responsibility to move culture (or really, to do anything other than make music)...but I <i>will</i> suggest that the amount that an artist <i>attempts</i> to move culture -- how seriously they take their position as cultural manufacturers -- is directly related to their value as an artist.<br /><br />That doesn't mean they have to take <i>themselves</i> seriously -- it's perfectly possible to take your work seriously without taking yourself seriously -- nor does it mean that they have to produce heavy, ponderous, meaning-filled works to be of value. (Did the world really need an <i>Operation: Mindcrime 2</i>? Come to think of it, did we need the first one?) Great work can be joyous, both to make and to listen to: \"Sweet Jane\" comes to mind here, and so does \"Mr. Tambourine Man\". (I also think of Soul Coughing songs like \"True Dreams Of Wichita\" and \"Circles\", but then, I'm convinced that Soul Coughing is one of the greatest unrecognized bands of the past two decades.) And it's possible to make deep songs that fill people with joy. \"Fake Plastic Trees\". \"Bittersweet Symphony\". Buckley's version of \"Hallelujah\". \"Such Great Heights\". These are just a few examples.<br /><br />But right now, rock is in one of those irritating and embarrassing phases where a band's image and attitude is worth more to the audience than their actual ability to actually write and/or play. We want arrogant rock stars who spend a lot of money to look casual, who fuck movie stars, who have publicists for their publicists and are more concerned with their marketing plan than with making great music.<br /><br />Is that what we really want? Do we really want rock stars as models? One of the great things about the aforementioned \"AltRock Revolution\" was that a lot of the people involved were plain-looking at best (Frank Black, <i>neé</i> Black Francis or Elvis Costello, Michael Stipe) and completely physically bizarre (Farrell, Shane McGowan) at worst. (I've seen Perry Ferrell up close, and he's not exactly a Ford model.) But that wasn't what was important. What <i>was</i> important was their drive and willingness to create something new.<br /><br />This is cyclical, and it's a shame we're at a low point. But I don't have much patience with the kids these days, either. They're either too stupid to realize that they're being duped into liking pretty, vapid crap by the massive machine of the entertainment industry's marketing component...or they just don't care, and just wanna dance. Which makes them vapid themselves.<br /><br />Ah, well. How much lasting work came out of the disco era? Only the reaction to it. (Unless you're one of these tired souls who really believes that \"Play That Funky Music\" is some sort of great art, in which case, you can choke on my dick.) It's a pity that nobody's reacting to the dullness of indie rock.<br /><br /><em>Note: If you're one of these hideous people who thinks that asking for substance and nuance and meaning from music is some form of passive racism (aka \"rockism\"), you may also feel free to choke on my dick.</em></p>",

            "source": {
                "content": "<p>I was extremely happy to see, earlier this year, that a film adaptation was being made of one of my favorite novels as a teenager, Susan Cooper's <em>The Dark Is Rising</em>. If you've never read the book -- or the other four books in the series -- they're worth your time, at least if you're into fantasy based upon British mythology. What characterizes the novels most for me -- and what made them stand out to me when I first read them -- is their intelligence and their pervasive sense of atmosphere. What I most remember about the novel is the way Cooper describes a small prosaic modern British town choked by snow and darkness -- a place that is literally and metaphorically being crushed under the weight of its own history. It's a quiet novel, and though the heart of it is a deep and desperate struggle between the Light and the Dark, it's thankfully short of wizard duels and big explosions. The confrontations between 11 year old protagonist Will Staunton, his ally and tutor Merriman Lyon, and the Dark -- represented by dark horseman the Rider and insane tramp the Walker -- are mostly metaphorical. There's a lot going on, but it's all behind the scenes.<br /><br />And who couldn't love dialogue like this? (Copied over from <a href=\"http://ozandends.blogspot.com/2006/10/questions-about-dark-is-rising-movie.html\">Oz and Ends</a>):<br /><blockquote>The rector stood up, his smooth, plump face creased in an effort to make sense of the incomprehensible. “Certainly it has gone,” he said, looking slowly round the church. “Whatever--influence it was. The Lord be praised.” He too looked at the Signs on Will’s belt, and he glanced up again, smiling suddenly, an almost childish smile of relief and delight. “That did the work, didn’t it? The cross. Not of the church, but a Christian cross nonetheless.”<br /><br />“Very old, them crosses are, rector,” said Old George unexpectedly, firm and clear. “Made a long time before Christianity. Long before Christ.”<br /><br />The rector beamed at him. “But not before God,” he said simply.<br /><br />The Old Ones looked at him. There was no answer that would not have offended him, so no one tried to give one. Except, after a moment, Will.<br /><br />“There’s not really any before and after, is there?” he said. “Everything that matters is outside Time. And comes from there and can go there.”<br /><br />Mr Beaumont turned to him in surprise. “You mean infinity, of course, my boy.”<br /><br />“Not altogether,” said the Old One that was Will. “I mean the part of all of us, and of all the things we think and believe, that has nothing to do with yesterday or tomorrow because it belongs at a different kind of level. Yesterday is still there, on that level. Tomorrow is there too. You can visit either of them. And all Gods are there, and all the things they have ever stood for. And,” he added sadly, “the opposite, too.”<br /><br />“Will,” said the rector, staring at him, “I am not sure whether you should be exorcized or ordained. You and I must have some long talks, very soon.”</blockquote><br />Brilliant stuff.<br /><br />So I was very, very unhappy to see the trailer for David Cunningham's film, which looks like a pretty blatant attempt to ride on some extremely profitable coattails. (I won't go into the massive and bizarre changes between book and film; <a href=\"http://community.livejournal.com/authorblog/5880.html\">someone's already done it for me</a>.) There's also <a href=\"http://ozandends.blogspot.com/2006/10/questions-about-dark-is-rising-movie.html\">a lot of discussion</a> about Cunningham's apparent evangelical bent...and it seems odd that they picked screenwriter John Hodge to adapt the novel; though he's definitely an excellent writer, he's most known for writing gritty and/or weird Danny Boyle films (<em>Shallow Grave, Trainspotting, A Life Less Ordinary, The Beach</em>) than fantasy.<br /><br />But of course, the path that leads us here is a pretty clear-cut one: <a href=\"http://www.jkrowling.com/\">novels about boy wizard</a> sell roughly a hundred trillion copies; <a href=\"http://harrypotter.warnerbros.com\">movie adaptations of said novels</a> do pretty much the same; good old Gandalf and Aslan (who, on screen at least, is a contracted employee of Walden Media, the same faith-based production company that's making <em>The Dark Is Rising</em>) are worth their weight in gold; suddenly, every producer in Hollywood is hunting the used bookstores for cheap young adult fantasy properties they can option and turn into their very own personal magical mint.<br /><br />Problem is, the \"kids\" haven't read <em>The Dark Is Rising</em>. It came out in 1973. And while you can probably turn any Newbury Award winning book into a movie and guarantee that parents will drop their Potter-besotted children into theater seats, your real audience for this film are the people who read it as children or teens and fell in love with it, and smart kids and teens who've never been exposed to it.<br /><br />Of course, that's not the billion dollar Harry Potter audience...but <em>The Dark Is Rising</em> is not Harry Potter. It's not full of expensive CG set pieces. You could probably make a pretty good and faithful adaptation for about $20 million, and earn your money back in the first week. And you'd end up with a great piece of cinema, both profitable and high quality, something to be remembered by.<br /><br />But I think <em>The Seeker: The Dark Is Rising</em> (as the film is clumsily titled; there's gonna be a sequel, kids!) is going to be at best a by-the-numbers Hollywood fantasy film, and at worst a complete train wreck...this despite the presence of Christopher Eccleston as the Rider, which is a nearly pitch-perfect piece of casting. As much as I like Ian McShane in <em>Sexy Beast</em> and <em>Deadwood</em> (where he actually plays a real-life ancestor of mine), he's totally wrong to play Merriman Lyon; I think <a href=\"http://www.mcgannbrothers.org.uk/productssimple0.html\">Paul McGann</a> would have been excellent in the role. From interviews I've read, it seems apparent that none of the filmmakers and maybe only one or two of the actors were familiar with the books before production. (McShane was <a href=\"http://www.movieweb.com/news/48/19848.php\">quoted as saying</a> \"I know they sold a few copies, but I couldn't read it very well. It's really dense. It's from the 70s, you know?\")<br /><br />So do me this favor: don't see it. Go buy the (doubtless marketed as a movie tie-in) book and read it instead. Punish these people with your wallet, and reward Susan Cooper for writing such an excellent novel.<br /><br />And maybe in another twenty-odd years, somebody will revisit this material and do it right.</p>",

I just finished <em>Spook Country</em> and it's brilliant, of course...but it's also really creeping me out, because little bits of it are weirdly mirroring my life over the last year or so.<br /><br />Random example: whilst in Berlin in December for the CCC, I had this moment where I was sitting in the window of my hotel room, looking down at the nighttime streets, my little German cellphone glowing in the dark, and I realized I was, in that moment, utterly a Gibson character. I was reading Norman Cohn's <span style=\"font-style: italic\">In Pursuit Of The Millennium</span>, that night, an obscure 1961 treatise on medieval apocalyptic sects. It's not a well-known book, and it was fairly hard for me to track down, though I think it's in print again now. It's part of my whole thoughtcluster on religion and gnosticism and postmodernism, which would take too long to explain here.<br /><br />In <em>Spook Country</em>, one of the main characters -- a drug-addicted translator who's been kidnapped and press-ganged into working for a shadowy spy who may nor may not be part of the US government --  keeps having strange dreams and hallucinations, most of which center around the book he's reading...an unnamed book, published in 1961, about obscure medieval apocalyptic sects, one chapter of which -- dedicated to the Brethren of the Free Spirit -- is entitled 'An elite of amoral supermen'.<br /><br />Guess what the chapter about the Brethen of the Free Spirit in Cohn's book is called?<br /><br />A couple of other little things -- the notion of using augmented reality coupled with GPS to create art projects, something I discussed with <a href=\"http://speedbird.wordpress.com/\">Adam Greenfield</a> way back in the day, and some of the business about ex-intelligence folks -- were also really specifically weird.<br /><br />All coincidence here, of course, and I don't think otherwise for a moment. But it's coincidence that's just obscure enough to be deeply creepy, for a moment or two.<br /><br />I'll tell Gibson about it when I talk to him next week. I meant to ask him about this stuff anyway. There's an entire subculture of people -- myself being one of them, Adam being another, Gibson's friend Bruce Sterling, maybe even you, my dear reader -- who are, for all intents and purposes, Gibson characters -- global travelers, immersed in the tropes of technology and bleeding-edge culture, deeply postmodern in our lives and in many ways unrecognizable to earlier generations of people. And most of us became that way because in some way or another, consciously or not, we <em>wanted</em> to be Gibson characters -- the console jockeys and corporate mercs and razorgirls of <em>Neuromancer</em> and \"Johnny Mnemonic\".<br /><br />Except now, Gibson's not writing about console jockeys and razorgirls anymore. He's not even writing about the future anymore. His stories take place in the present, and his protagonists are media consultants and virtual artists and post-rock musicians, and he bases them, so far as I can tell, on real people who are the way they are because of <em>his work</em>.<br /><br />Which is perhaps the most postmodern thing I can think of.<br /><br />(Seriously, though, the thing with the Cohn book is just weird, though I suppose it mainly just suggests that Gibson and I are thinking about a lot of the same things.)</p>",
